It is every parent’s dream for their child to go to college. They’ll do anything to get them there. Some parents, such as my mother, go to extremes. She started programming the idea into the brains of my brothers and I since middle school. 

Till this day, I remember our first brain wash session. My four brothers and I are all gathered around in the living room when our mother drops four bulky, crimson folders on the table.

“This is what you need to get into Harvard!” she said. 

It took us a second to realize, she had printed the entire admissions process; all four of us stared at each other, trying not be the first to laugh.

“Sure mom. Like it’s that easy," my brother Juan said. 

Our mother, nevertheless, insisted. She looked at us with the same faith an army sergant projects to his command; after all, that's how she saw us, as her command. All we saw, however, was the typical mother, who thought too highly of her children. 

In the four years leading to the college applications process, we had serveral meetings like this. When college applications came around, we applied to dozens of colleges, our mom made sure of it. And months later, as admission decisions arrived, all of us were thankful to have been accepted into great colleges; and… my brother Juan, who had so adamantly argued in disbelief, was accepted into Harvard.

I don't know how much of an impact those folders had; but, at least by coincidence, our mom proved her case. But what exactly was it?

I've always wondered, why didn’t my mom demand more--why college? I don't mean to say that Harvard, or any college, is not a worthy achievement. But, unless success is guaranteed by a diploma, it is only a means to a promising life, and not the only option. So why didn’t my mom print out Steve Jobs’ Wikipedia page, instead? 

**Magic**

College is made out to be a necessary ingridient to success. What do people assume comes of it? 

“Here is your diploma, mix it in a cauldron with your resume, and the name of an important person you’ve met. Abracadabra!”

That recipe might seem silly, but people like to believe that is not the case. The other day, my friend, who’s trying to start a business, says to me, “You’ve made it, man! You go to Penn, you have everything you need there!” People are under the illusion that because someone goes to a ‘better’ school their life is made. They’re working like hell to get to where they want, but believe it’s different for others. I only wish that was the case.

In News From The Front, Paul Graham gives an insider perspective:

> “There’s nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad.

> [..]

> Because how much you learn in college depends a lot more on you than the college. A determined party animal can get through the best school without learning anything. And someone with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart people to learn from at a school that isn’t prestigious.”

Prestige is not a golden ticket. It’s a cushion, and many people get too comfortable. Some students might have more opportunities, but that doesn’t make another person’s case hopeless nor theirs destined.

Wherever you go — whatever you do — you have to work extremely hard to get to the next level. College is another step in the ladder.


Obviously, it’s not that easy. College isn’t a magic formula. It’s a magic trick. What we see at the end isn’t how it works. There’s a lot of behind the scenes preparation.

It’s easy to think otherwise. Schools, after all, work like a coin trick. The same way a magician uses pretend movements as distractions, schools have students moving around hastily, from classes to meetings to study sessions, mimicking others. They begin to believe there’s some unknown force at work when, in reality, they’re the ones doing all the work. Coins disappear, parents lose their money, and kids still believe it’s magic.

Don’t let the college dream become an illusion.

It’s not the system at work. It’s YOU.

That leaves three questions:

+ Does it matter where you go to college? For most people, yes. Where someone goes can limit or unleash their potential. But it doesn’t have to be that way.  You have full control over what and who you choose to believe. Don’t leave your fate up to a college admissions officer.
+ Is college necessary? It depends. For some people/careers it’s the right decision. For them, college is a great opportunity (and a great time) if used correctly. That doesn’t make it the only option. Self-education is as powerful and today more possible than ever. Keep an open mind and trust yourself. Or, even better, use them together and you’ll be unstoppable. As Jim Rohn says, “Formal education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune.”
+ Could talents be put to better use? I believe so. Imagine where all the young, intelligent, ambitious young people would be if, instead of using all their time, money, and energy to cram for exams and fix up their resume, they invested all their effort into the real world. There are, of course, a few outliers that already give us a hint of what’s possible.

Whatever you end up doing, remember, whether the trick works or fails — the final outcome — depends on you.
