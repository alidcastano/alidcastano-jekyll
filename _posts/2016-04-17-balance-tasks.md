Habits are great. I've learned to cherish them and I've spent years trying to become a master of mine.  

But sometimes, I fear, we become too preoccupied with having the perfect schedule and routine. We become too methodical with our lives. While our body, and life in general, doesn't work that way. 
(habits -- automate your success)
Schools teach us to do work we don't like. Success dogma teaches us to build perfect habits. I agree, these are all important facets of life. But they miss the global point...
Paul graham: 
>One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.
>discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.

Here's the gist of what I asked him: 

"You are a writer, musician, and programmer. You've created a million dollar startup and wrote a best-selling book. Your accomplishments align with my goals, so, I'm wondering, how did you, and continue, to get it all done?"

How do you divide time between activities that require long chunks of singular focus?

So how do you balance your time between tasks? You don't! You go with what's pressing on you most. 



I'll be working when creativity strikes. But what will I be working on? Well, I'll let my body determine that. 


The real secret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat when you’re hungry, to sleep when you’re tired, to take a break when you’re bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.
