My first attempt at letting go of attachment was an expensive one. I had finished reading, Be Here Now. A book I started reading because it had a profound impact on Steve Jobs--and now, after reading it, on me as well. A feeling inside pressed upon me to be more conscious, less attached, more Zen. I wanted my life to immediately reflect this new mode of being. 

I decided to start by analyzing the place where I spend most of my time, my room. There's so much stuff I don't *need* in here, I thought. I should get rid of it. 

And so, the purge began. I took down my posters. I gave away my sofa, and my desk. I packed away all the clothes I barely wore, which ended up being most of them, so I also gave away my dresser. My friends were happy. 

But I wasn't. All that was left in my room were white walls and my bed and coffee table. My room felt, well, empty. I didn't think it would look so, bare. I thought I would feel more Zen. But I just felt naked.   

Will the people who come in think I'm boring? Or, poor? All my insecurities started coming out. 

I really wish I would of slept on this, I thought. Or at least not have given everything away.

To fill my gap of disillusionment, I went on Amazon. I intended to buy a desk and an arm chair, to make my room look more Zen. I figured that would help. But I got carried away with the search and 1-click purchases, in the same way a broken lover gets carried away with a bucket of ice-cream. And I ended up with a small table fountain and a tapestry and a zabuton, as well. 

My room, now, felt more Zen. Sure. But I felt like an impostor. 

While reading, Be Here Now, there was a passage that particularly stuck out to me. I didn't realize why, until now. It was about how all the people who travel to India in hopes of meeting Yogi who will change their life, often end up disappointed. They travel all that way only to learn, as the book says, "Where you are going is HERE and you will arrive NOW." 

I found myself in the same place as those muddled travelers. I tried to get my outside world to reflect how I wanted to feel and who I wanted to become. It reminds me of how back in middle school, I would start the school year all excited with a fresh set of school supplies thinking, this year is the one. But despite my cool folders and pens, there's an internal aspect to change that I can't fake or skip over. There's a character I need to mold and habits I need to build. And that takes more than one trip to target, or one empty room. 




moving around all that furniture taught me 

 Nor should I want to. Because by trying to do so, I put all my focus on the result (emptying out my room) rather than the process (letting go of attachment), and miss out on what I set out to accomplish (overcoming my dependence on the material world). 



You are where you need to be. And so am I. I might still own more than I need, but at least now I realize that I am where I need to be. And so am I. So let's stop trying to be anywhere else; embrace the process.
