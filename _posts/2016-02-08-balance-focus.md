I'm terrible at switching tasks. I set the timer for two hours, and when those two hours go by, I just continue working--I can't help it. The unfinished task consumes my thoughts and I can't move on until I'm finished.

My problem isn't managing time, but focus.

If I only had one task on my to do list, this wouldn't be a problem. But as I try to divide my time between writing, speaking, and programming--oh, and school--my lack of willpower becomes stressing.

How do successful people do it? Take a guy like [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/), for example. He started a company to help independent musicians like himself and years later sold it for $22M; he's written the best book I've ever read on entrepreneurship, [Anything You Want](http://www.amazon.com/Anything-You-Want-Derek-Sivers/dp/1936719118); and his [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers) have over 5M views. In summary, he's basically checked off my entire list of goals.

Luckily, I also found out that he answers ALL emails (don't ask me how) that ask for his advice. 

So I decided to email him and ask--how the hell do you get everything done?

Here's what he responded:

Wow, I expected some fancy habits or productivity hack. But his answer was, essentially, the reverse: to listen to my body. 

So work as I normally do, but not feel guilty or stressed about it--let it happen. 

My problem, I realized, was I trying to force myself to do a little bit each day, which is equivalent to trying to do everything at once. A more effective approach is to focus on a meaningful activity for few days, weeks, or months (maybe even years) at a time, and s-l-o-w-l-y let the small accomplishments build up.

So how do you balance your focus between tasks? You don't! Just let whatever has your attention direct your efforts.

So I'll still be hard at work everyday. But what exactly will I be working on? Well, I'll let my body determine that. 

Thanks Derek.
