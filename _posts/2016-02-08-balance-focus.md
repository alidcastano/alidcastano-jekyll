title:  How to balance your focus between diverse ambitions

I'm terrible at switching tasks. I set the timer for two hours, and when two hours go by, I just continue working--I can't help it. The unfinished task consumes my thoughts and I can't move on until I'm finished.

My problem isn't managing time, but focus.

If I only had one task on my to do list, this wouldn't be a problem. But as I try to divide my time between writing, speaking, and programming--oh, and school--my lack of willpower becomes stressing.


[Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) is a guy I really admire. He started his first company to help independent musicians and sold it for $22M, giving the proceeds to charity; he's written the best book I've read on entrepreneurship, [Anything You Want](http://www.amazon.com/Anything-You-Want-Derek-Sivers/dp/1936719118); and his [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers) have over 5M views.

Best of all, he answers ALL emails (don't ask me how) that ask for his advice. 

So I decided to email him. Here's the gist of what I asked him: "Derek, your accomplishments align with my goals so, I'm wondering, how the hell do you get everything done?"

His response:

So how do you balance your focus between tasks? You don't! Just let whatever has your attention direct your efforts. 

My problem, I realized, was I was trying to do a little bit each day, which is the equivalent to trying to do everything at once. A more effective approach is to focus on the activity a few weeks or months (maybe even years) at a time. No fancy habits or productivity hacks, just work hard on something meaningful, and s-l-o-w-l-y the small accomplishments build up.

I'll still be working hard everyday. But what exactly will I be working on? Well, I'll let my attention determine that. 

Thanks Derek.
