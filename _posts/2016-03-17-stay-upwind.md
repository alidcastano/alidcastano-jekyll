title: What should you do if you don't know your passion?
---

Most career advice is based on the idea that you know what you want to spend your life doing. Only then can you pursue the life you want. 

But life rarely works that way. You likely only have a vague idea of what you want to do with your life, and even that idea is constantly changing. 

Accepting this, how can you best decide your path forward?

In [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html), Paul Graham transforms the typical "Standford Graduation speech" into practical advice he wish he had known. 

His advice has become the heuristic I use for any life decisions. I've condensed his essay into the points that impacted me most. Here's what I'm glad to have learned: 

## Only on safe direction to go: Upwind

I used to decide based on what I thought I wanted to do and work backwards to get there. I'd ask, "Is this necessary?" and rationalize the easy way out. 

Now I don't pretend that I know what I want to do with my life. So I can't fake that I know what I'll need. In any decision it is almost as if I can hear Paul Graham whisper, "Stay Upwind." As he describes it:

>I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
>
>[...]
> 
>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. 

Every decision, inevitably, narrows down your future options. But some do so more than others. The trick is to pick the options that keep you upwind, or widen your alternatives. 

Based on where you're at now, which option will give you the most leverage in the future? 

## As a compass, look for hard problems 

To be exact, here's how Graham distinguish them: 

> Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.

Use your level of concern to estimate the difficulty of the task. How comfortable do you feel--does it feel like your are are writing a novel, or reading one? You want to experience eustress, a healthy type of stress that stretches you.  

Think of hard as heavy, and treat your work like a workout. Focus on progressive overload. Add just enough difficulty to feel challenged but not so much that someone else needs to solve the problem for you. The ultimate aim being to progressively grow more comfortable under the pressure of hard problems.

## Follow your curiosity

Even then, how can you be sure you'll enjoy the work? You need what Graham identifies as the key ingredient to great work: 

> Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve....to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. 

The best protection to doing work you love enjoy is focus your efforts on the problems you are genuinely curious about. Exercising this filter is hard in practice. Often harder than the problem itself. But there's no point in staying upwind only to be stuck with a wide range of options you dislike. So don't let yourself be swayed by money or prestige or other false motives. Make curiosity your primary motive. 

## Treat school as your day job

In that respect, start working on what you care about now. Don't put your ambitions on hold. Far too many people put their interests aside because "they already have enough work." But school is your best opportunity. School, as Graham suggests, is your day job:

> I'd treat it like a day job... It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. 


So embrace that you don't know what you want to do with your life and prepare for the day that you might. 

Instead of following your passion, follow hard problems you're curious about. 

Start working on them now.

Instead of not giving up on your dreams, continue to work forward from promising situations. 

Stay upwind.
