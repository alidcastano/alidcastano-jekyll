title:  What I'm glad to have realized (thank you Paul Graham)

How are you suppose to make decision based on wHat you don't know

## When you don't know what to do, Stay upwind.


Here's how it really works: you have some vague idea of what you want to do and each step you're inevitably narrowing down your decision. Not just by exploring what you like and don't like, but because in doing so you're also choosing which knowledge, skills, and experience you acquire. 

Not just in terms of what you think you like and don't like, but of what you think is possible for you to achieve and in what you are capable of achieving. 



-- difference between adults and kids is realize take responsibility..
I think the sooner you relaize you don''t have time, you take responsibility


I shouldn't live my life expecting to have the answers. Rather, with the knowledge that I never will and I need to act on what I know now.

here are three things I've though I wanted to do with my life in the last few years: start a youtube/blog about fitness, become a motivational speaker, and start my successful company. 

the decisions I made leading up to those major decisions would influence the options I had to choose from when the time came. 


decision is not based on what we like, but 1) beliefs and 2) experience 

[Paul graham - upwind/hard problems, cal newport - career capital/deliberate practice, steve jobs - connect the dots backwards]

every decision, inevitably, is a sunk cost, an intellectual and emotional investment that effects my subsequent range of options. 


"Do you really need this?" my friend asked. 


I didn't have time. 



It wasn't until late sophomore year, when I read Paul Graham's [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html), that I realize that. In this essay, he transforms the typical "Stanford Graduation Speech," the  into practical advice he wished he had known. 

"Don't give up on your dreams," and all the typical graduation speeches, give the assumption that you are suppose to act based on knowledge of what you you love to do.


implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. 



I stumbled upon this essay my sophomore year of college. I've referred to it several times since then, whenever I've been faced with difficult life decisions, to steer me in the right direction. Which is, what Graham describes as, upwind: 




I always tried to think about what I wanted to do with my life 

>In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
>
>It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.
>
>Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.
>
>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. 

Working backwards from your goals, or trying to follow your dreams, is like walking towards a dead end. You're soon to run out of answers about where to go or what to do.

A more practical alternative, as Graham put it, is to stay upwind, and work forward from promising options. Based on where you're at now, which decision will give you the most wind, or leverage, in the future? The higher your altitude, or ability, the wider range of promising options to choose from when you choose to land.

I've used this metaphor as a heuristic for difficult decision. The most recent one being, ["Should I learn to code?"](/TODO) It was as if I could hear was Paul Graham whispering, "Stay upwind." 

Now, after more than 6 months experience programming, it feels as if I have a new superpower. That's not to say I'm the best programmer. Far from it. But, I'm higher upwind. I don't have to spend weeks to months looking for a programmer to help me create some vague idea. I can prototype and validate it myself within days. More options to choose from. More places to land.

But in decisions that are not as definitive, how can you ensure you stay upwind? As a compass, look for hard problems. To be exact, here's how Graham distinguish them: 

> Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.

I particularly like to think of hard as heavy, and treat my work like I would a workout. I focus on progressive overload. I add just enough weight that I'm thankful to have my spotter next to me but not so much that he has to lift it for me. The goal is to experience eustress, the healthy type of stress that stretches you, and progressively grow more and more comfortable under the pressure of hard problems. 

Use your level of concern to estimate the difficulty of the task. Always ask,  how comfortable do I feel--do I feel like I'm are writing a novel, or reading one? If you find you've gotten too comfortable reading, put some weight on the bar, bro.

Even then, a problem can be solve in many ways. In order to solve it well, you need what Graham identifies as the key trait to great work: 

> Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve....to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?

The best protection to doing work you love enjoy is focus your efforts only on the hard problems you are genuinely curious about. Exercising this filter, I've found, is often harder than the problem itself. But don't swayed by money, prestige, or other false motives. There's no point in staying upwind only to find you've been heading in wrong direction. 

An important realization, in that respect, is that start working on stuff you care about now. Don't put your ambitions on hold. The difference between adults and kids, Graham notes, that is that adults realize take responsibility. Could he do school again, he says: 

> I'd treat it like a day job... It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. 

I talk with far too many people who've put their interests aside because "they already have enough work." It serves to remember, school is only your day job. So treat it as such, and any chance you get, do real work. Work that you care about. 

Instead of following your passion, follow a hard problem you've been curious about and start solving it, now. Instead of not giving up on your dreams, continue to work forward from promising situations, stay upwind.
