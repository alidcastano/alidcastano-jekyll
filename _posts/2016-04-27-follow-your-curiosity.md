## Don't let the current take you 

"They took the lifting platforms out of the gym." I said. "I can work with staff to try and bring them back." I was in a student government meeting and out of all the possible improvements we could lobby for, that was my suggestion. 

I obviously didn't belong there. But it was what I did in high school. Plus, having the position looked good. And my mother was happy to see I was involved. 

Several reasons, none of which really matter. I realized I was spending several hours per week on something I didn't enjoy and never thought about, which was evident by my suggestion. I'm happy to have resigned before I could make another one. 

When you don't have a solid grasps of what work your passionate about it's easy to pulled by other factors. 

Prestige will try to convince you to work on something you don't like. 

>Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world...Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like....If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige.

Money will try to lend a hand, and convince you it's worth it. 

>The other big force leading people astray is money....The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for itâ€”even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?

And your parents will support you, as long as your safely employed. 

>All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards. If your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.

There's no point in staying upwind only to be stuck with a wide range of options you dislike, regardless of the justification. 

Doing work you love is an upstream battle. You have to make a conscious effort to not be swayed by the opinions of your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige--or sheet inertia. 


## As a compass, follow your curiosity


Instead, follow your curiosity. It is what Graham identifies as the key to great work: 

> Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.
>
> If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?

Curiosity morphs a stressful task into an interesting challenge. Focus your efforts on work that genuinely interest you, and that's what your life will become.

## Treat school as your day job 

In that respect, start working on what you care about now. Far too many people put their ambitions on hold because "they already have enough work." But school, as Graham suggests, is only your day job:

> Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.

In this way, your passion arise from the projects you finish on the side.

> "Always produce" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. "Always produce" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.

So embrace that you don't know what you want to do with your life and prepare for the day that you might. 

Instead of following your passion, follow hard problems you're curious about. 

Start working on them now. Always produce. 

Instead of not giving up on your dreams, continue to work forward from promising situations. 

Stay upwind.
