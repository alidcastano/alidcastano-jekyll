I'll be honest, I didn't actually talk with Steve Jobs. At least not in the way you'd expect. I imagined my conversation with him. A more sophisticated version of an imaginary friend, you could say. Nonetheless, I understand how that still may sound pathetic, so let me explain. 

In Napoleon Hill's *Think and Grow Rich* there's a passage where Napoleon Hill talks about imaginary council meetings he used to host with men of the likes of Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin, who's lives and works inspired him. Hill studied records of their lives and with that knowledge animated the character of these men and conversated with them. This exercise, he said, helped guide his actions and mold his character. 

I experiment with a similar exercise here. Except, instead of a council meeting, it's a casual chat with Steve jobs. I based his side of the conversation on real advice he'd given and my side is me trying to make sense of it, from his perspective. It seemed silly when I started. But our conversation brought a surprising amount of clarity to what his advice on doing what you love. If you're trying to figure out what to do with your life, our conversation below is worth the read.

####Enter Steve Jobs: 

Mr. Jobs, or should I call you Steve? Well, Steve, I feel lost. I don't know what I want to do with my life. What should I do? 

Well, Alid... Jobs urged, "If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.”

Steve, I'm sorry, but this wanderlust encouragement can leave anyone helpless. Like searching for treasure in the sand without a metal detector. You're saying I'm simply to trust my instincts? 

As crazy as that sounds, I can't help but believe you. Because coming from you, the advice takes on a different tone. It's not just keep looking, don't settle; it's an affirmation that, yes, if I persist, it is possible. We wake up every day with a part of you in our hands as proof. 

So, Steve, I concede. But if I'll know when I find it, what should I do now to look for it? 

Take my life as an example, Alid...Jobs went on to explain, "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever."

Steve you and Apple seem like a match made in heaven. Seeing what you accomplished, I'm suspicious as to if connecting some dots will lead me to accomplish anything near your caliber. 

If I didn't know your life any better, I'd call BS. But thee more you tell me about your life before Apple, the more I start to believe you. I find reassurance in knowing that, like me, you didn't always have your life figured out. 

Heck, you were as lost as any of us. Probably even more. From being a college dropout dropping into Calligraphy courses to a part-time technician designing outdated arcade games to a jobless barefoot and bald monk in the Himalayas. 

Yet it was this quest to find your calling that created you for Apple. With your unconventional personality, sensibility to design, and inclination towards electronics, you accumulated enough experience to notice something missing in the world. *Why does computer design have to be so complicated?* you questioned, with the same curiosity that Henry Ford questioned luxury cars.

Ok, Steve. I think I'm starting to get it. I don't need to have everything figured out. Its normal to feel lost. Expecting to have all the answers in order to start is as helpful as getting all my answers from the back of the textbook. Part of the significance of solving the question is the understanding that comes in working through the problem. 

A better approach, as you suggested, is to start with what you know. In an given moment, for example, I can distinguish between work that feels forced and work that intrigues me, and exercise the courage to do more of the latter. And, step by step, build upon that knowledge, connecting the dots. As long as I'm willing to trust and do my half, the other half will follow. 

Exactly, Alid. But you have to be careful... Jobs went on to forewarn, "Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly already want to become."

Yes, Steve, I admit, I already do feel that pressure. There is just so much uncertainty in finding my own way. Doing so inherently means not doing what everyone else is doing. I feel like a purple cow walking away from its herd. I can't help but to second guess my instincts. That doubt and fear tempted to align my life with what everyone else is doing. 

But then I think about how forced life felt. Like being trapped in a cage. Except the bars were a crowd of people. And since everyone else was trapped with me, it felt normal. But I don't want to feel normal. I want to feel alive. 

I think that's what separates you from the rest. Not some innate quality we label upon every successful person. But that you had the courage to question the norm and act on your curiosity. You had the courage to live. 

Right on, Alid...Steve went on to conclude, "That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it."
