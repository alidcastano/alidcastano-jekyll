Paul Graham's two essays, [How to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) and [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html), are the best life advice I've ever received. These last few years it has been my heuristic for any difficult decisions. Below is the advice I found most useful:

## Don't let your fears make decisions for you

As I sat in the first lecture of an introduction to calculus class my freshman year, I asked myself, "Is this necessary?" Right when class ended I went to the bookstore and returned the course textbook.  

The real question on my mind that day: "Can I handle this?" I was unsure if I would be able to keep up with the material. I feared I was not as smart as the other students in the class. I didn't want to risk wrecking my GPA. 

My form of "I can't" was "I don't need this."

Both of which were lies. And as I read Graham's essays, I could sense him calling me out on it:

>It's painful to keep them apart [to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible], because it's painful to observe the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations... Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing [or any other skill] for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say "I can't."


>And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.

Frankly, I didn't know if I would need calculus or not. But it was easy to convince myself I wouldn't, that I could avoid it. Now, whenever I deal with math, I always feel it necessary to clarify, "I never took calculus." Only to hear, "You don't need calculus for this, but it helps." 

Maybe I can survive without it. Now I don't have a choice. 

Any decision you make out of fear, or laziness, the more you limit yourself. 

So don't prematurely judge your ability. Beliefs are self-fulfilling. And don't pretend to know what what's necessary. Life will rarely work out the way you expect. You can never be over-prepared. 

Which preludes the next question I used to wonder: If you don't know your passion, how do decide your path forward? 

## Only one direction to go: Upwind

Fall semester of my sophomore year I got this random food app idea. I decided to start my first startup. I spent months working on the business plan and pitch deck; I felt ready to pitch to investors. Only to confront the fact that I didn't have a product.  

And, unlike Steve Jobs, I was not friends with any Steve Wozniaks. I spent three unsuccessful weeks trying to find a technical co-founder. It was debilitating to realize: my success was entirely dependent on the off chance that a talented programmer would fall on my lap and code my idea. 

"Should I learn to code?" The only thing I knew about programming courses is how hard and time consuming they are, because everyone complains about it. I pictured the kid who started playing with computers when he was 9. I could never compete with him. And lingering in the back of my mind was the fact that I didn't take calculus, ergo, I sucked at math. 

I was doing it again. Letting my fears get the best of me. 

Except this time, it was like I could hear Paul Graham echoing, "Stay Upwind." 

As he describes it:

>I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
>
>[...]
> 
>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. 

I've been learning programming for more than 6 months now. I feel as if I have a new superpower. If tomorrow I get another idea for a startup, I don't have to spend weeks searching for a programmer. I can prototype the idea and validate it myself, within days. 

It doesn't matter, I've realized, if I can become the best programmer or not. Even if a problem takes me longer to solve. Or if I get a worse grade. What matters is that I'm a better version of myself.

I'm higher upwind. 

Your best protection, as well, is to always work on hard problems. 

Another way, is to think of hard as heavy. Approach your work as if it were a strenuous workout. Your are lifting weights with your brain. The problems you work on should be difficult enough that you fear failure but not so much that a spotter has to solve it for you. There has to be suspense, suspense that you can handle. 

You want to grow progressively more comfortable under the pressure of hard problems. And, eventually, life will feel like light weight.


## As a compass, follow of your curiosity

"They took the lifting platforms out of the gym." I said. "I can work with staff to try and bring them back." I was in a student government meeting and out of all the possible improvements we could lobby for, that was my suggestion. 

I obviously didn't belong there. But it was what I did in high school. Having the position looked good. And my mother was happy to see my involved. 

Several reasons, none of which really matter. I realized I was spending several hours per week on something I didn't enjoy and never thought about, which was evident by my suggestion. I'm happy to have resigned before I could make another one. 

When you don't have a solid grasps of what your passionate about it's easy to pull by other factors. 

Prestige will try to convince you to work on something you don't like. 

>Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world...Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like....If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige.

Money will try to lend a hand, and convince you it's worth it. 

>The other big force leading people astray is money....The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for itâ€”even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?

And your parents will support you, as long as your safely employed. 

>All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards. If your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.

There's no point in staying upwind only to be stuck with a wide range of options you dislike, regardless of the justification. 

Doing work you love is an upstream battle. You have to make a conscious effort to not be swayed by the opinions of your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige--or sheet inertia. 

Instead, follow your curiosity. It is what Graham identifies as the key to great work: 

> Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.
>
> If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?

Curiosity morphs a stressful task into an interesting challenge. Focus your efforts on work that genuinely interest you, what your life will become.

## Treat school as your day job 

In that respect, start working on what you care about now. Far too many people put their ambitions on hold because "they already have enough work." But school, as Graham suggests, is only your day job:

> Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.

In this way, your passion arise from the projects you finish on the side.

> "Always produce" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. "Always produce" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.

So embrace that you don't know what you want to do with your life and prepare for the day that you might. 

Instead of following your passion, follow hard problems you're curious about. 

Start working on them now. Always produce. 

Instead of not giving up on your dreams, continue to work forward from promising situations. 

Stay upwind.
