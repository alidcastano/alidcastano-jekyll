     The real secret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat when you’re hungry, to sleep when you’re tired, to take a break when you’re bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.

"Its mute, it can't communicate with you," Wilson tells 

 Maybe you should try communicating with it."
"Your the dominant side, you make all the decisions." 
"The right side has no control over anything, must be frustrating."

The biggest dilemma with solving hard problems is we do everything to avoid them. How can I make them more friendly.

the trick is to make hard problem seem friendlier.

An idea at its inception is like an untamed beast. 

I've found these four questions helpful:

### Is the problem too big or abstract? 

When I decided I wanted to design my website, I procrastinated the project for days. The reason being that I never got clear about what I needed to work on. "Design a website" is a goal, not a task. But once I broke down my goal into concrete, actionable steps (create fixed header, create fade-in footer, etc.), I finally had a lists of tasks I could work on. 

//at inception an idea is like a wild beast that your right brain can't handle on its own. It needs the left brain to tame it down.

Does the problem you're trying to solve seem too big or abstract? Delegate work to yourself with the same precision you would if you were delegating it someone else. Because, in a way, you are--the left, logical side of your brain is deciding what is feasible and actionable, so that the right, creative side of my brain can finally get to work. 

It might seem like overkill, but the less room you leave for ambiguity, the less room you leave for procrastination. 

### Does the problem feel to complex or daunting?

When I first started writing, I'd spend hours staring at a blank page. Not because I didn't have anything to write, but because I was being too judgmental of my writing, before giving myself the chance to improve it. 

//I can't express myself and judge my work at the same time. 

When I set out to write now, I give myself a small quota of two pages and however terrible the words may come out, I give myself permission to write badly. A brain dump of two shitty pages turns a blank page into a first draft that I can work to improve. 

The left and right side of my brain aren't arguing anymore. The right side of my brain was free to express itself, and now my meticulous left side can do what it does best, scrutinize, edit, and flesh out the details.


Sometimes it works the other way around. When I get stuck on a problem while programming, for example, I write the outer body of the function and then inside the function I write comments about the problem I'm trying to solve. After figuring out the structure and details, writing what goes inside the function afterwards feels more manageable. 

Point is, when you feel stuck, don't just stare blankly--get something done right away. Simplify the problem in any way you can so that you feel less intimidated and give yourself some momentum.

## Does the problem feel forced?

Have a friend assign you another task so that you can procrastinate with the problem you want to work on.

// It becomes something the left side of your brain wants to do but your right side doesn't want to work on 

// even if it's something that you would otherwise enjoy, once you have to do it, the fun gets sucked out of it 

Procrastination is a part of human nature. When you feel like you have to work on X, then all of a sudden that becomes the toughest thing to make yourself work on. But if you can have someone else assign you task Y, then the exact same X becomes easier. I think that's why writing feels so easy to me, it's not something I feel I have to do and I have a long list of other assignments I'm avoiding. 

PRO TIP: Solve a meta-problem. (have other people rely on you -- external motivation)
>Another way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem. Instead of building a web application, try building a web application framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.

// If these three things are aligned, then all I need is some inspiration to kick me into gear.
