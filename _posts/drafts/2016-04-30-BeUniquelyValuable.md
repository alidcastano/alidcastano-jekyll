How do people get stuck with jobs they hate? That's one lesson I don't intend to learn the hard way. Which means that along with knowing what to do, I need to know what not to do. So I've developed a working theory for both, one that I believe will prove handy for the both of us.

To do so, I've drawn on the wisdom of a few great minds. Particularly, Scott Adams, the creator of the famous Dilbert cartoon. Given that he's predicted nine out of the nine political events[^fn-Adams] that led to the unforeseen Trump nomination, it's evident he understands what factors lead to success better than 99% of America.

"If you want an average successful life it doesn’t take much planning," Adams says. "Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like." The predicament is that "like" is too loose term for someone young. At such an age, your receptors are stimulated more by certain colors---namely, green and gold---which makes it easy to convince yourself you like something for the wrong reasons. And like so, the majority of hard working graduates end up with the same style of mass-produced success: an unsatisfying job that pays the bills.

You might be wondering, why couldn't they optimize for both factors? Put simply, for the same reason they feel stuck in their current careers. Which we'll get into in a second. But first, we need to address a similar but more pertinent concern. That is, how can you plan an escape---one that doesn't just include the weekend? 

"If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths," Adams says. You can try to become the best at one specific skill; or, as he recommends, become "pretty good"---top 25%---at two or three skill, to form a unique package that makes you rare and valuable. 

As an example, Adams cites his [career](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html):

>Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

Another way I think of this approach, is as Cal Newport advocates: [become so good they can't ignore you](/book/SoGood); except, "so good" doesn't necessarily imply one domain---you can carve out a clear and narrow niche where you alone, with your specific arsenal of skills, can conquer.

When I think of successful people I admire, all of them followed some variety of this path, as well. A notable example is Arnold Schwarzenegger. On the basis of his acting alone, Arnold was in no way remarkable; nor did he have to be. Arnold was able to leverage his bodybuilding persona to create his own niche as an actor; the roles he played were as if made exclusively for him.

In a similar manner, this approach is about developing a unique mix of skills that'll make you indispensable in any domain you might want to enter. 

Now on to the next logical question on your mind, the question of what specific skills to develop. I'm glad you asked it, because the answer to that question is what constitutes a person's success. Sadly, from this point forward many ambitious people are led astray with bad advice. I've been a victim. So to be safe, here's what Adams foretells you should do:

>At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal...Now add to that whatever your passion is, and you have two, because that’s the thing you’ll easily put enough energy into to reach the top 25%. If you have an aptitude for a third skill, perhaps business or public speaking, develop that too.

I can tell you from experience, the exact sequence of that advice matters. There's this aura in college that you should study what you like, an aura that many students are suffocated by. I know because I've gotten a good whiff of it myself. 

What undergraduate wouldn't prefer and feel more capable studying the intricacies of persuasion, willpower, and Marshmallow Tests more than the idea of having to spend 20+ hours pulling their hairs trying to implementing a chat server? Naturally, I drifted towards studying psychology. I was more "passionate" about it. 

Passion is a lovely affair, until reality slaps you in the face. My cheeks are still a tad red from being slapped a few times. Like when I first started blogging. With all the papers we write in school, what could be difficult about it. That's what I figured, until I realized I could barely string my thoughts together, let alone withstand other people scrutinizing them. Writing a school paper, compared to that, is a cinch to do; you write about someone else's thoughts and no one reads it. 

Or when I tried to start my [my first startup](/StayUpwind). A couple months in, my co-founders and I sat to discuss equity. One was a programmer. The other a good communicator. As for me? Well, that's when I fully realized that without a base of concrete skills, all I was, was a passionate idea guy; as rare and valuable as the average student. Even if I did feel more physically and mentally more prepared than them for battle. One was armed with a gun and the other with a knife, and to them, I was just another body.

The effects of passion became ever clearer when I tried to start my first startup. A couple months in, my co-founders and I sat to discuss equity. One was a programmer. The other a good communicator. As for me? I had no technical expertise and I'm an introvert. Frankly, I couldn't concretely describe what I brought to the table---because I didn't bring anything concrete. That's when I fully realized that without a base of concrete skills, all I was, was a passionate idea guy; as rare and valuable as the average student. 

When I realized how pointless my existing education was to my goals, I wanted to [drop out](/TheCollegeIllusion). But that too, I realized, would have been an equivalent mistake. What would I have done? College, like it or not, was my time buffer. I was best off using whatever opportunity I could find, inside or outside of classes, to become useful---to develop concrete skills.  

Coincidently, that's also the advice famed entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreeseen, who's [career guide](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html) inspired this posts, gives students:  

>If you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start developing concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the better...Once you get into the real world and you're primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.
>
>[...]
>
>Graduating with a technical degree [or any other useful skill] is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons.

Put another way, your first priority is not to discover what you like, as most school counselors will tell you; your first priority is to become useful. 

Passion is invigorating, but too shaky to rely. Each of us have an infinite capacity of self deception and more often than not, passion is used to fuels excuses. Focus on it too early on and it'll only serve to disguise your fears and prevent you from embracing the very hard work that, while excruciating, makes you useful.

Think about it, psychology by itself is just interesting bits of knowledge that anyone can learn, and most do enjoy learning. Much less people are willing to put in the hours of difficult, deep work required to become decent writers, or speakers, or programmers. But only in that way can you bring your study of psychology to life through stories like [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell); or in seminars like [Tony Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins); or through an app like [Stickk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StickK). 

As a contrast, if your first instinct is to follow my whims and flee from the drudgery, your likely to end up like a stray dog---in the streets without the ability to fend for yourself. That's at least how hopeless I felt 2 years ago, without the ability to bring my ideas and visions to reality. And I think it's the same feeling most people stuck with careers they hate feel, as well; because the only practical skills they developed  were after graduation, in the exact career they feel stuck with. 

Indeed, anything you leave to passion, is everything you leave to luck. It's smarter to serve those reserves and make your decisions as robust as possible.  A reality-proof approach is to always [stay upwind](/StayUpwind), to stay on the safe side of the harder path. 

For example, I might not *need* programming to be a successful entrepreneur. But it's a skill I've been learning because it improves my ability to create. 
Even if I can' help me code the next Facebook, it'll at least allow me to better understand technology and relate to engineers, making me a better product manager. In that manner, harder paths leave more room for err; I can always yield to passion later.

The approach, as I've come to see it, is to first develop a base of concrete skills that can be useful anywhere. That way, hen you touch base with a specific domain that resonates with you, call it your passion if you like, you can package everything together into your own gift of expertise. You'll be, as I plan to be, in the likes of the Scott Adam's, Arnold Schwarzenegger's, and Marc Andreessen's of the world; uniquely valuable.
