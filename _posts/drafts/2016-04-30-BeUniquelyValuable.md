How do people get stuck with jobs they hate? That's one lesson I don't intend to learn the hard way. Which means that along with knowing what to do, I need to know what *not* to do. So I've developed a working theory for both, one that I believe can be handy to the both of us.

I'm by no means an expert in this subject, but I've drawn on the wisdom of Scott Adams, the creator of the famous Dilbert cartoon. And given that he's predicted [nine out of nine political events](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/136261193951/ranking-the-best-political-pundits-of-2015) that led to the unforeseen Trump nomination, it's evident he understands what factors lead to success better than 99% of America. 

"If you want an average successful life it doesn’t take much planning," Adams says. "Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like." The predicament is that "like" is too loose term for someone young. At such an age, your receptors are stimulated more by certain colors---namely, green and yellow---which makes it easy to like something for the wrong reasons. And like so, most graduates end up with the same 
mass-produced style of success: a job that pays well, but that you hate.

You might be wondering, why couldn't they optimize for both factors? Put simply, for the same reason they feel stuck in their current careers. Which we'll get into in a second. But first, we need to address a more pertinent concern. How can you plan an escape that doesn't just include the weekend? 


"If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths," he says. You can try to become the best at one specific skill; or, as he recommends, become "pretty good"---top 25%---at two or three skill, to form a unique package that makes you rare and valuable. 

As an example, Adams cites his [career](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html):

>Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

When I think of successful people I admire, all of them followed some variety of this path, as well. A notable example is Arnold Schwarzenegger. On the basis of his acting alone, Schwarzenegger was in no way remarkable; nor did he have to be. Schwarzenegger create [his own niche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDxn0Xfqkgw) as an actor, such that the roles he played were as if made exclusively for him.

Another way to think of this strategy, is as Cal Newport advocates: [become so good they can't ignore you](/book/SoGood). Except, "so good" doesn't necessarily imply one domain. You can carve out a clear and narrow niche where you alone, with your specific arsenal of skills, can conquer.

Now on to the next logical question on your mind, the question of what specific skills to develop. I'm glad you asked it, because the answer to that question is what constitutes a person's success. Sadly, from this point forward is where many ambitious people are given bad advice and led astray. I've been a victim. But before I share my experience, I'll once again first let Adams foretell what you should do:

>At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal...Now add to that whatever your passion is, and you have two, because that’s the thing you’ll easily put enough energy into to reach the top 25%. If you have an aptitude for a third skill, perhaps business or public speaking, develop that too.

To be clear, the exact sequence of those steps matters. There's this aura in college that you should major in what you like. An aura that most people who feel stuck in their careers were intoxicated by. I know because I've gotten a good whiff of it myself and have felt it's sap.

Who wouldn't prefer and feel more capable studying the intricacies of persuasion, willpower, and Marshmellow Tests more than the idea of having to spend 20+ hours in one week pulling your hairs trying to implementing a chat server? Naturally, I drifted towards studying psychology. I was more "passionate" about it. 

Passion is a wondrous affair, until reality slaps you in the face. My cheeks are tad red from being slapped a few times. When I started blogging and realized I could barely string my thoughts together, let alone withstand the experience of other people scrutinizing them. A school paper, compared to that, is a cinch to do, you write about someone else's thoughts and no one reads it. 

Or when I tried to start my [my first startup](/StayUpwind). A couple months in, my co-founders and I sat to discuss equity. One was a programmer. The other a good communicator. As for me? Well, that's when I fully realized that without a base of concrete skills, all I was, was a passionate idea guy; as rare and valuable as the average student. Even if I did feel more physically and mentally more prepared than them for battle. One was armed with a gun and the other with a knife, and to them, I was just another body.

Passion, I learned, can disguise our fears and prevent us from embracing the hard work that, while excruciating, makes us useful. Think about it, psychology by itself is just interesting bits of knowledge that anyone can learn, and most do enjoy learning. Much less people are willing to put in the hours of difficult, deep work required to become decent writers, or programmers. But only in that way can you bring your ideas to life through stories like [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell), or through code by creating a web app like [Stickk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StickK). 

When I realized how pointless my existing education was to my goals, I wanted to [drop out](/TheCollegeIllusion). But that too, I realized, would have been an equivalent mistake. What would I have done? College, like it or not, was a time buffer, I needed to use whatever years I had left to prepare myself, to develop concrete skills. 

Coincidently, that's also the advice famed entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreeseen, who's [career guide](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html) inspired this posts, gives:  

>If you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start developing concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the better...Once you get into the real world and you're primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.
>
>[...]
>
>Graduating with a technical degree [or any other useful skill] is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons.

Put another way, if your first instinct is to follow your passion, to flee from the drudgery of hard work, your likely to end up like a stray dog, in the streets without the ability to fend for yourself. Your first priority is to develop skills that will allow you to survive and thrive. 

Most students, however, relinquish their side projects and aren't slapped by this realization too late in life, when they already feel trapped. But I'm letting you in on the secret early.

The approach, as I've come to see it, is to first develop a base of one or two concrete skills that can be useful anywhere. That way, when you touch base with a specific domain that resonates with you, call it your passion if you like, you can package everything together into your own gift of expertise. 

If you do so, you'll be, as I plan to be, in the likes of the Scott Adam's, Arnold Schwarzenegger's, and Marc Andreeseen's of the world; uniquely valuable, and not to mention, very rich.
