How do people get stuck with jobs they hate? That's one lesson I don't intend to learn the hard way. But I'll share with you my working theory, which Scott Adams, the creator of the famous Dilbert cartoon, has helped me formulate. 

"If you want an average successful life it doesn’t take much planning," he says. "Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like." 

That's how it starts. The problem is that "like" is too loose term for someone young. Specially considering that your receptors are stimulated by some colors more than others---namely, green and yellow---which makes it easy to like a job for the wrong reasons. And like so, most graduates end up stuck with the same mass produced style of success that schools prepare us for: successful enough to earn a nice living, but not so much so as to earn a satisfying work life.

Why can't you optimize for both? For the same reason they feel stuck in their current careers. I'll explain that below. But first, we need to address a more important question: how can you plan an escape that doesn't just include the weekend? Fortunately, Scott Adams has an answer for that, too. And given that he's predicted [nine out of nine political events](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/136261193951/ranking-the-best-political-pundits-of-2015) that led to the unforeseen Trump nomination, it's evident he understands what factors lead to success better than most people. 

"If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths," he says. You can try to become the best at one specific skill; or, as he recommends, become "pretty good"---top 25%---at two or three skill, to form a unique package that makes you rare and valuable. 

As an example, Adams cites his [career](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html):
>Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

When I think of successful people I admire, all of them followed some variety of this path, as well. A notable example is Arnold Schwarzenegger. On the basis of his acting alone, Schwarzenegger's was in no way remarkable. But with his masterful  [one liners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDxn0Xfqkgw) and massive personality, Schwarzenegger was able to create his own niche as an actor. The roles he played were as if made exclusively for him. 

Another way to think of this strategy, is as Cal Newport advocates: [become so good they can't ignore you](/book/SoGood). Except, "so good" doesn't necessarily imply one domain; you can carve out a clear and narrow niche where you alone, with your specific arsenal of skills, can conquer.

What specific skills should you develop? Here's what Adams recommends:

>At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal...Now add to that whatever your passion is, and you have two, because that’s the thing you’ll easily put enough energy into to reach the top 25%. If you have an aptitude for a third skill, perhaps business or public speaking, develop that too.

I'll emphasize, the exact sequence of those steps matters. There's this aura in college that you should major in what you like, one that I believe most people who feel stuck with their careers were intoxicated by. 

I say that because I've felt the effects first hand. What freshman wouldn't prefer and feel more capable studying the dynamics of persuasion, willpower, and Marshmellow Tests more than the idea of having to spend 20+ hours in one week pulling your hairs trying to implementing a chat server? Naturally, my first two years in college I drifted towards psychology and marketing. I was more "passionate" about it. 

It wasn't until the fall of my sophomore year, when I tried to start [my first startup](/StayUpwind), that I realized without a solid base of concrete skills, I'm just an idea guy; as rare and valuable as the average student.     Passion, I learned, can disguise our fears and prevent us from embracing the hard work that, while excruciating, makes us useful. 

Think about it, psychology by itself is just interesting bits of knowledge that anyone can learn, and most do enjoy learning. Much less people are willing to put in the hours of difficult, deep work require to become "pretty good" at a skill like writing or or programming. But only in that could you bring your ideas to reality through writing like [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell), or through code by creating a web app like [Stickk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StickK). 

Most people don't realize this until it's halfway to late. I luckily procrastinated declaring my major until my junior year and was able to switch to Cognitive Science, which has allowed me to squeeze in a few programming courses. I also took a course sophomore spring to become a [speaking advisor](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/cwic/), which has dramatically improved my own speaking, but that was more Tony Robbins inspired serendipity rather than insight. Point is, take any opportunity you can, inside and outside of school, to develop concrete skills. That should be your number one priority. 

In fact, that's also the advice famed entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreeseen, who's [career guide](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html) inspired this post, gives:  

>If you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start developing concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the better...Once you get into the real world and you're primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.
>
>[...]
>
>Graduating with a technical degree [or any other useful skill] is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons.


The approach, which I've learned the hard way, is to first develop a base of one or two concrete skills that can be useful anywhere. That way, when you touch base with a specific domain that resonates with you, call it your passion if you like, you can package everything together into your own gift of expertise. 

If you do so, you'll be, where I plan to be, in the likes of the Scott Adam's, Arnold Schwarzenegger's, and Marc Andreeseen's of the world; uniquely valuable, and very rich.
