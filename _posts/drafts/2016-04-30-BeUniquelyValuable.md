There's this aura in college that you should study what you like. An aura that many students are suffocated by; and I'm not saying that condescendingly. I only know because I've gotten a good whiff of it myself. 

What undergraduate wouldn't prefer and feel more capable studying the intricacies of persuasion, willpower, and Marshmallow Tests more than the idea of having to spend 20+ hours pulling their hairs trying to implementing a chat server? Naturally, I drifted towards studying psychology. I was more "passionate" about it. 

Passion is a lovely affair, until reality slaps you in the face. My cheeks are still a tad red from being slapped a few times. Like when I first started blogging. With all the papers we write in school, what could be difficult about it. That's what I thought, until I realized I could barely string my thoughts together, let alone withstand the experience of other people scrutinizing them. Writing a school paper, compared to that, is a cinch to do; you write about someone else's thoughts and no one reads it. 

The effects of passion became ever clearer when I tried to start my first startup. A couple months in, my co-founders and I sat to discuss equity. One was a programmer. The other a good communicator. As for me? I had no technical expertise and I'm an introvert. Frankly, I couldn't concretely describe what I brought to the table. Which I came to realize was because, at that point in my life, I didn't bring anything concrete. Even with all my passion, I was just an idea guy; I was as rare and valuable as the average student. 

When I realized how pointless my existing education was to my goals, I wanted to [drop out](/TheCollegeIllusion). But that too, I realized, would have been an equivalent mistake. What would I have done? College, like it or not, was my time buffer. I was best off using whatever opportunity I could find, inside or outside of classes, to become useful---to develop concrete skills.  

Coincidently, that's also the advice famed entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreeseen, who's [career guide](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html) inspired this post, gives:  

>If you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start developing concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the better...Once you get into the real world and you're primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.

>[...]

>Graduating with a technical degree [or any other useful skill] is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons.

Put another way, if your first instinct is to follow your passion, to flee from the drudgery of hard work, your likely to end up like a stray dog---in the streets without the ability to fend for yourself. That's at least how hopeless I felt 2 years ago, without the ability to bring my ideas and visions to reality. And I think it's the same feeling most people stuck with careers they hate feel, as well.

Passion, I learned, can disguise our fears and prevent us from embracing the hard work that, while excruciating, makes us valuable. Think about it, psychology by itself is just interesting bits of knowledge that anyone can learn, and most do enjoy learning. Much less people are willing to put in the hours of deep work required to become decent writers, or speakers, or programmers. But only in that way can you bring your study of psychology to life through stories like [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell); or in seminars like [Tony Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins); or through an app like [Stickk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StickK). 

How can you know what approach to take? That too, was my next question. Good advice on this topic is unfortunately, rare. I've had to shovel through a lot of bad advice, but luckily, recently discovered a chunk of great advice. 

### Be Uniquely Valuable

The strategy I've now following is based on the advice of Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert cartoon. Given that Adams has predicted nine out of nine political events[^fn-Adams]that led to the unforeseen Trump nomination, it's clear he understands what factors lead to success better than 99% of America. So politics aside, I propose that you too, build off his wisdom.

If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths, Adams says. You can try to become the best at one specific skill; or, as he recommends, become "pretty good"---top 25%---at two or three skill, to form a unique mix that makes you rare and valuable. 

As an example, Adams cites his [career](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html):

>Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

Another way I think of this approach, is as Cal Newport advocates: [become so good they can't ignore you](/book/SoGood); except, "so good" doesn't necessarily imply one domain---you can carve out a clear and narrow niche where you alone, with your specific arsenal of skills, can conquer.

When I think of successful people I admire, all of them followed some variety of this path, as well. A notable example is Arnold Schwarzenegger. On the basis of his acting alone, Arnold was in no way remarkable; nor did he have to be. Arnold was able to leverage his bodybuilding persona to create his own niche as an actor; the roles he played were as if made exclusively for him.

In a similar manner, this approach is about developing a unique mix of skills that'll make you indispensable in any domain you might want to enter. Not all of us will automatically be as fortunate as Arnold, however, so don't risk leaving anything in the hands of luck or mere passion. Make your decisions as robust and reality-proof as possible; whenever you have the choice of two skills, [stay upwind](/StayUpwind).
