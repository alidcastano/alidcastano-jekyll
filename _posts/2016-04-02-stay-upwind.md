Paul Graham's essay, [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html) is the most practical and robust life advice I've ever come across. His advice will completely transform the way you think about and make decisions, as it did for me. Below are the insights that impacted me most, what I'm glad to have learned:

## Don't let your fears make decisions for you

As I sat in the first lecture of an introduction to calculus class my freshman year, I asked myself, "Is this necessary?" Right when class ended I went to the bookstore and returned the course textbook.  

The real question on my mind that day was: "Can I handle this?" I was unsure if I would be able to keep up with the material. I feared that I was not as smart as the other students in the class. I didn't want to risk wrecking my GPA. 

My form of "I can't" was "I don't need this."

Both of which were lies. And as I read Graham's essay, I could sense him calling me out on it:

>It's painful to keep them apart [your idea about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible], because it's painful to observe the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations... Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing [or any other skill] for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say "I can't."

>And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.

Frankly, I didn't know if I would need calculus or not. But it was easy to convince myself I wouldn't, that I could avoid it. That, however, did not mean it wouldn't affect me. 

Whenever I deal with math now, I feel it necessary to clarify, "I never took calculus." Only to hear, "You don't need calculus for this, but it helps." 

Maybe I can survive without it. Now I don't have a choice. 

Any decision you make out of fear, or laziness, the more you limit yourself. 

Beliefs are self-fulfilling. If you prematurely judge your ability or what's necessary, you'll never prove yourself wrong. Life will rarely unfold as you expect. Only once you accept this, can you benefit from the advice below. 

## Only one direction to go: Upwind

In the fall semester of my sophomore year I got this random food app idea. I decided to start my first startup. I spent months working on the business plan and pitch deck. I felt ready to pitch to investors. Only to confront the fact that I didn't have a product.  

And, unlike Steve Jobs, I was not friends with any Steve Wozniaks. I spent three unsuccessful weeks trying to find a technical co-founder. It was debilitating to realize that my success was entirely dependent on the off chance that a talented programmer would fall on my lap and code my idea. 

"Should I learn to code?" It was the first time I entertained the idea. I pictured the kid who started playing with computers when he was 9--I could never compete with him. The only thing I knew about programming courses was how hard and time consuming they are, because everyone complained about them. And lingering in the back of my mind was the fact that I didn't take calculus, ergo, I sucked at math. 

I was doing it again. Letting my fears get the best of me. 

Except this time, it was like I could hear Paul Graham echoing, "Stay Upwind." 

As he describes it:

>I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
>
>[...]
> 
>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. 

I've been learning programming for more than 6 months now. I feel as if I have a new superpower. If tomorrow I get another idea for a startup, I don't have to spend weeks searching for a programmer. I can prototype the idea and validate it myself within days.

It doesn't matter, I've realized, whether I can become the best programmer or not. Even if a problem takes me longer to solve. Or if I get a worse grade. What matters at is that I'm a better version of myself at the end.

I'm higher upwind. 

Your best protection, as well, is to lay on the safe side of hard problems. 

Think of hard as heavy and approach your work like a strenuous workout. As you progressively grow more comfortable under the pressure of hard problems, eventually, life will feel like light weight.

Thank you Paul Graham, for helping me realize that.
