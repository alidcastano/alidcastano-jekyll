Paul Graham's essay, [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html), is the most practical and robust life advice I've ever come across.  Below is the insight that impacted me most, what I'm glad to have learned:

---

As I sat in the first lecture of an introduction to calculus class my freshman year, I asked myself, "Is this necessary?" Right when class ended I went to the bookstore and returned the course textbook.  

The real question on my mind that day was: "Can I handle this?" I slacked off in high school and was unsure if I would be able to keep up with the material. I feared that I was not as smart as the other students in the class. I didn't want to risk wrecking my GPA. 

My form of "I can't" was "I don't need this."

Both of which were lies. And as I read Graham's essay, I could sense him calling me out on it:

>It's painful to keep them apart [your idea about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible], because it's painful to observe the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations... Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing [or any other skill] for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say "I can't."

>And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.

"I'm lazy," is what I should have admitted to myself. I didn't want to risk putting in hours of work, only to be disappointed. It was easier to convince myself I wouldn't need calculus, that I could avoid it--and now I don't have a choice. 

Any decision made out of fear or laziness--anytime you underestimate your ability--the more you limit yourself. Only once you accept this fact, as I had to, can you benefit from the advice below, that changed the way I make decisions. 


## Only one direction to go: Upwind

In the fall semester of my sophomore year, my friend and I got this random food app idea and decided to start a startup. We spent months working on the business plan and pitch deck. We felt ready to pitch to investors--only to confront the fact that we didn't have a product.  

I spent the next three weeks, unsuccessfully, trying to find a technical co-founder. It was debilitating to realize that our success was entirely dependent on the off-chance a talented programmer fell from the heavens onto our lap. 

"Should I learn to code?" It was the first time I had entertained the idea. The only thing I knew about programming courses was how hard and time-consuming they are, because everyone complained about them. All I could picture was the kid who started playing with computers when he was 9. I could never compete with him.  And lingering in the back of my mind was the fact that I didn't take calculus, ergo, I sucked at math. 

I was doing it again. Letting my fear and laziness get the best of me. 

Except this time, I could Paul Graham's advice echoing in the back of my mind: 

>I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
>
>[...]
> 
>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind.

"Stay Upwind" overrode any excuse I could make.

I've been learning how to program for more than 9 months now. I feel as if I have a new superpower. If tomorrow I get another startup idea, I don't have to spend weeks searching for a programmer. I can prototype the idea and validate it myself within days. 

I'm higher upwind. 

It doesn't matter, I've realized, whether I can become the best programmer or not. Even if a problem takes me longer to solve. Or if I get a worse grade. What matters is that I'm a better version of myself at the end.

Thank you Paul Graham, for helping me realize that.
