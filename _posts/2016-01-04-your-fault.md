My mother, I've noticed, has developed an acumen over the years for pointing out what I do wrong. In. Any. Situation.  

Earlier this morning, we're both leaving Panera Bread. I stretch out the chest of my shirt and point at a small, orange mark on it. "Is this going to stain, Mom?" I asked. "I hate wearing white."

"You hate being a pig, you mean!" she said. 

Yep, that could be it as well. Thanks, Mom. 

Then, later this evening my dog, Rocky, poops inside my room. I (mildly) spank him, to make him think twice before doing it again, and my mom yells at *me*.

"Shouldn't you be mad at the dog?" I said, pointing at the poop.  

"If you don't take him out, what do you expect?" she said. 

I expected someone else to take him out, I admitted. Yet there I was punishing Rocky, a puppy incapable of opening a door, for not walking himself outside. 

I should have smacked myself across the head, instead. In moments like these, we all should. 

Consider, if we are quick to blame helpless beings and inanimate objects for our misfortunes, how readily we must also blame other people for everything that happens to us.

These experiences may seem trivial, but they concede to a larger pattern. The way we react to everyday interactions, admittedly, is a lot like how we react when food stains our shirts or pets poop in our room. 

All upset, the last person we blame is ourselves. Your friend lied, so he lost your trust. Your partner cheated, so you ended the relationship. You got upset because someone did not act as you expected. 

What if, for a change, instead of acting on, *Why does this happen to me?* you were to ask, *What did I do to cause this?*

It wouldn't make the other person's actions any more right, no. But it would allow you to identify what role you played. Maybe you didn't show enough affection. Maybe you were too judgmental. Maybe you didn't do your part. 

If you notice the same problems occurring, that maybe is worth exploring. You are likely to notice a pattern. Generally, that it is futile to expect someone to behave a certain way if you don't first align your actions with that expectation. 

In my case, I'm still going to avoid wearing white. I'm not cut out for it. But I will try to be more considerate with my dog, since I care about him. 

In fact, for anyone or anything worth keeping around, I'm going to try to exercise my mother's judgment and take responsibility for my faults, first. 

I'm sure your parents also have an acumen for pointing out what you do wrong. So experiment with me. I hypothesize that, like magic, all our problems will start to change.
