It is every parent’s dream for their child to go to college. They’ll do anything to get them there. Some parents, such as my mother, even go to extremes. 

Till this day, I remember our first conversation about college. My mom summoned my three brothers and I to the living room for a family meeting. She comes in and gives each of us a bulky, crimson folder. 

“This is what you need to get into Harvard!” she says. 

My brothers and I stared at her blankly. It wasn't until we opened the folders that we realized: she had printed out the harvard admissions page. 

We didn't know if she was serious. My brothers and I were still in middle school.

"A little too much time on your hands, mom?" I said, flipping through the pages.  

“Sure mom. That easy," my brother Juan said. He pointed at the acceptance rate, which read 6.8%.

Despite our ensuing remarks, our mother insisted. So we amused her and took the folders. 

That day, as we laughed at her for believing in us, never would I have expected she'd prove us wrong. Five years later, my brother Juan was accepted into Harvard.

This experience redefined my beliefs about what I thought possible. But it's also made me question a system society blindly accepts. Why college? I don't mean to say that Harvard, or any college, isn't a worthy achievement. But, unless success is guaranteed by a diploma, it is only a means to a promising life. Why didn’t my mom print out Steve Jobs’ Wikipedia page, instead? 

Is college necessary? It gives the necessary credentials for some carreers, sure. But what about for those of us pursuing other paths that don't require them? There's nothing special about college that, with discipline and without debt, you couldn't get another way. 

People, however, don't realize this. We put more faith in college than we do ourselves. We've been tricked. 

College is one big coin trick. To make a coin dissapear a magician uses pretend movements as distractions. Schools, similarly, have students moving around, from classes to meetings to parties, mimicking others, as their parent's money dissapears, or debt escelates. Everyone is led believe there is some unknown force at work worth the cost. 

Except it's not the system at work. It's you. There's nothing magical about college. Self-education is as powerful and, today, more possible than ever. You could invest that same effort allocated to school--all your time, money, and energy used cram for exams and fix up your resume--into the real world. Imagine where many young, intelligent, ambitious young people would be if that happened. (There are, of course, a few outliers that already give us a hint of what’s possible.)

How should you decide which path to take? The most partical advice I've come across is: [become so good they can't ignore you][]. If you think college can aid with what that entails for you, test it out. Otherwise, believe in yourself and dare to explore other options. 

And, whatever you do, remember, whether the trick works or fails, the final outcome, depends on you.
