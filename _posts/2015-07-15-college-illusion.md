It is every parent’s dream for their child to go to college. They’ll do anything to get them there. Some parents, such as my mother, even go to extremes. 

Till this day, I remember our first conversation about college. My mom summoned my three brothers and I to the living room for a family meeting. She comes in and gives each of us a bulky, crimson folder. 

“This is what you need to get into Harvard!” she says. 

My brothers and I stared at her blankly. It wasn't until we opened the folders that we realized: she had printed out the harvard admissions page. 

We didn't know whether to take her seriously. We were yet to finish middle school. 

"A little too much time on your hands, mom?" I said, flipping through the pages.  

“Sure mom. That easy," my brother Juan said. He pointed at the acceptance rate, which read 6.8%.

We all began to poke fun. But despite our remarks, our mother insisted. She looked at us with the same faith an army sergant projects to his command. All we saw was a mother who thought too highly of her children. But since all my brothers and I wanted was to go back to playing video games, we amused her and took the folders. 

It was this same moment that I thought about five years later as we applied to colleges and as admission decisions arrived. I never thought my mom would have been right. My brother Juan was accepted into Harvard. 

That day marked a powerful lesson for me about the power of beliefs. But I'm still unclear about who, or what, I'm supposed to believe in. 

If my mother knew success is a matter of preperation and conviction, why didn’t my mom demand more from us? Why college? I don't mean to say that Harvard, or any college, is not a worthy achievement. But, unless success is guaranteed by a diploma, it is only a means to a promising life, and not the only option. So why didn’t my mom print out Steve Jobs’ Wikipedia page, instead? 

College is made out to be this necessary ingridient for success. What do people assume comes of it? 

“Here is your diploma, mix it in a cauldron with your resume, and the name of an important person you’ve met. Abracadabra!”

Obviously, it’s not that easy. College isn’t a magic formula. It’s a magic trick. What we see at the end isn’t how it works. There’s a lot of behind the scenes preparation.

It’s easy to think otherwise. Schools, after all, work like a coin trick. The same way a magician uses pretend movements as distractions, schools have students moving around, from classes to meetings, mimicking others. Parents lose their money and kids believe there’s some unknown force at work when in reality they’re the ones doing all the work.

Don’t let the college dream become an illusion. 

It’s not the system at work. It’s YOU.

Imagine where all the young, intelligent, ambitious young people would be if, instead of using all their time, money, and energy to cram for exams and fix up their resume, they invested their efforts into the real world. There are, of course, a few outliers that already give us a hint of what’s possible.

Which leaves the question, is college necessary? It is for some careers. But that doesn’t make it the only option for everyone. Self-education is as powerful and today more possible than ever. Keep an open mind and trust yourself. Or, even better, use them together. As Jim Rohn says, “Formal education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune.”

Whatever you end up doing, remember, whether the trick works or fails — the final outcome — depends on you.
