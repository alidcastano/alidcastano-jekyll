My first attempt at letting go of attachment was an expensive one. I had finished reading, Be Here Now. A book I started reading because it had a profound impact on Steve Jobs--and now, after reading it, on me as well. A feeling inside pressed upon me to be more conscious, less attached, more Zen. I wanted my life to immediately reflect this new mode of being. 

I decided to start by analyzing the place where I spend most of my time, my room. There's so much stuff I don't *need* in here, I thought. I should get rid of it. 

And so, the purge began. I took down my posters. I gave away my sofa  and my desk. I packed away all the clothes I barely wore, which ended up being most of them, so I also gave away my dresser. My friends were happy. 

But I wasn't. All that was left in my room were white walls and my bed and coffee table. My room felt, well, empty. I didn't think it would look so, bare. I thought I would feel more Zen. But I just felt naked.   

Will the people who come in think I'm boring? Or, poor? 

I really wish I would have slept on this, I thought. Or at least not have given everything away.

To fill my gap of disillusionment, I went on Amazon. I intended to buy a desk and an armchair, to make my room look more Zen. I figured that would help. But I got carried away with the search and 1-click purchases, the same way a distraught lover gets carried away with a bucket of ice-cream. And I ended up with a small table fountain and a tapestry and a zabuton, as well. 

My room, now, felt more Zen. Sure. But I felt like an impostor. 

By focusing all my effort on the external result (emptying out my room) rather than the internal process (letting go of attachment), I missed out on what I set out to accomplish (overcoming my dependence on the material world).

While I was reading, Be Here Now, there was a passage that particularly stuck out to me. I didn't realize why, until now. It was about how all the people who travel to India in hopes of meeting Yogi who will change their life, often end up disappointed. They travel all that way only to learn, as the book says, "Where you are going is HERE and you will arrive NOW." 

Like the muddled traveler, I mistook my ideal surroundings for who I wanted to become. No matter how much I try, I've realized, there's an internal aspect to change that can't be faked or rushed. 

My first attempt at minimalism, sadly, turned into a room makeover. But the experience helped me realize: I am where I need to be. And so are you. So let's stop rushing or pretending to be anywhere else. :)
