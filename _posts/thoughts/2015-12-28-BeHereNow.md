My first attempt at letting go of attachment was an expensive one. I had finished reading, *[Be Here Now]()*, a book on spirituality and meditation. I started reading because it had a profound impact on Steve Jobs--and now, after finishing it, on me as well. A feeling inside pressed upon me to be more conscious, less attached, more Zen. 

I wanted my life to immediately reflect this new mode of being. I decided to start by analyzing the place where I spend most of my time: my room. There's so much stuff I don't *need* in here, I thought. I should get rid of it. 

And so, the purge began. I took down my posters. I gave away my sofa  and my desk. I packed away all the clothes I barely wore, which ended up being most of them, so I also gave away my dresser. My friends were happy. 

But I wasn't. All that was left in my room were white walls and my bed and coffee table. I didn't feel any more Zen, nor did my room look it. My room looked, well, empty. And I felt naked. 

To fill my gap of disillusionment, I went on Amazon. I intended to buy a desk and an armchair, to make my room look more Zen. I figured that would help. But I got carried away with the search and 1-click purchases, the same way a distraught lover gets carried away with a bucket of ice-cream. And I ended up with a small table fountain and a tapestry and a zabuton, as well. 

My room, now, felt more Zen. Sure. But I felt like an impostor. By focusing all my effort on the external result (emptying out my room) rather than the internal process (letting go of attachment), I lost sight of what I set out to accomplish (overcoming my dependence on the material world). 

There was a passage in *Be Here Now* that particularly stuck out to me. I didn't realize why, until now. It was about how all the people who travel to India in hopes of meeting Yogi who will change their life, often end up disappointed. They travel all that way only to learn, as the book says, "Where you are going is HERE and you will arrive NOW." 

Like the muddled travelers, I mistook my ideal surroundings for who I wanted to become. No matter how much I try, I've realized, there's an internal aspect to change that can't be faked or rushed. 

I am where I need to be. 

And so are you. 

So let's stop rushing or pretending to be anywhere else. :)
