This morning my dog, Rocky, unapologetically pooped inside my room. In return, I gave him a soft spank in the butt. I wanted him to think twice next time before leaving unwelcome gifts in my room. The punishment felt warranted.

My mom, however, standing nearby as the event unfolded, yelled at *me* for spanking him.

"Shouldn't you be mad at the dog?" I said, pointing at the poop.  

"If you don't take him out, what do you expect?" she said. 

I expected someone else to take him out, I admitted. Yet there I was punishing Rocky, a puppy incapable of opening a door, for not walking himself outside. 

What I realized, at poor Rocky's expense (yes, I already apologized to him), is how rarely I consider my own role in undesirable outcomes. Yet that's the only factor I have full control over. 

Admittedly, The way we react to everyday interactions is a lot like how we react when pets poop in our room. All upset, the last person we think to blame is ourselves. Your friend lied, so he lost your trust. Your partner cheated, so you ended the relationship. Someone did not act as you expected, so you got upset and acted accordingly. 

But did you ever consider the role you played? Maybe you were too judgmental.  Maybe you didn't show enough affection. Maybe you didn't do your part. 

Your blame wouldn't make the other person's actions right. But it would allow you to identify where your control lies. Rather than hold grudges, you can learn from your mistakes. Rather then complain, you can do your part in making sure it doesn't happen again. 

How often do you say, *Why does this keep happening to me?* Perhaps, if you notice the same problems occurring, the role you played is worth exploring. You are likely to notice a pattern. Generally, that it is futile to expect someone to behave a certain way if you don't first align your actions with that expectation. 

As Derek Sivers writes in [Everything Is My Fault](https://sivers.org/my-fault), "they’re just delivering the punch-line to the joke you set up." But when you decide that everything is your fault, "now you’re the powerful person that made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it. Now you’re in control and there’s nothing to complain about."

I'm going to try and exercise the same approach from here on, EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT. 

Join me, instead of acting on, *Why does this happen to me?* pause, breathe, and ask, *What did I do to cause this?* I predict that, slowly, our problems will start to change form, maybe even disappear.
