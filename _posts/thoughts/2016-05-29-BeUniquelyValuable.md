title: How to make yourself indispensable

quote: |

--- 


How do people get stuck with jobs that they hate? That’s one lesson that I don’t intend to learn the hard way---which means that along with knowing what to do, I need to know what *not* to do. So, with the guidance of a few great minds, along with personal experience, I've hashed out my thoughts on a few do's and don'ts going forward.

First, a do. The advice comes from the creator of the Dilbert cartoon, Scott Adams. And given that he's predicted nine out of the nine political events[^fn-Adams] that led to the unforeseen Trump nomination, it's evident he understands what factors lead to success better than 99% of America.

"If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths," Adams says. You can try to become the best at one specific skill; or, as he recommends, become "pretty good"---top 25%---at two or three skills, to form a unique package that makes you rare and valuable. 

As an example, Adams cites his [career](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html):

>Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

Another way I think of this approach, is as Cal Newport advocates: [become so good they can't ignore you](/book/SoGood). Except, "so good" doesn't necessarily imply one domain---you can carve out a clear and narrow niche where you alone, with your specific arsenal of skills, can conquer.

When I think of successful people I admire, all of them followed some variety of this path, as well. A notable example is Arnold Schwarzenegger. On the basis of his acting alone, Arnold was in no way remarkable, nor did he have to be. Arnold was able to leverage his bodybuilding persona to create his own niche as an actor; the roles he played were as if made exclusively for him.

In a similar way, the approach is to develop a unique mix of skills so that you'll be indispensable in any domain you chose enter later. But, obviously, not all of us will have the same outright good fortune as Arnold. We need to leave less wiggle room for luck. The most robust strategy I've come across is from startup mastermind Paul Graham. 
His heuristic: [stay upwind](/StayUpwind), take the harder path earlier on.

The heuristic is crucial to your choice skills and the timing which you choose to develop them. But in this regard, unfortunately, many ambitious people are ill-advised. In college specially, there's this aura that you should first study what you like, an aura that many students are suffocated by---I know because I've gotten a good whiff of its effects myself. 

What undergraduate wouldn't prefer and feel more capable studying the intricacies of persuasion, willpower, and [Marshmallow Tests]() more than the idea of having to spend 20+ hours pulling their hairs trying to implementing a chat server? Naturally, I drifted towards studying psychology rather than programming; I was more "passionate" about it. 

Ah, passion is a lovely affair---until reality slaps you in the face. My cheeks are still a tad red from being slapped a few times. Like when I first started blogging. With all the papers I write in school, I figured starting a blog couldn't be too difficult. Kinda like how kids feel when they find out Santa Claus doesn't exist, I soon found out I could barely string my thoughts together, let alone withstand other people scrutinizing them. Writing a school paper, compared to blogging, is child's play; you write about someone else's thoughts and no one reads it. 

The effects of passion became even clearer when I tried to start my first startup. A couple months in, my co-founders and I sat down to discuss equity. One was a programmer. The other a good communicator. As for me? Frankly, I couldn't describe what I brought to the table---because I didn't bring anything concrete. Without a base of concrete skills, all I was, was a passionate idea guy; as rare and valuable as the average student. 

When I realized how insufficient my existing education was to my goals, I wanted to [drop out](/TheCollegeIllusion). But then, what would I have done?
Dropping out, I concluded, would have been the same mistake, repeated.

If your first instinct is to follow your whims, to flee from drudgery, your likely to end up like a stray dog---in the streets without the ability to fend for yourself. That's at least how hopeless I felt two years ago, without the ability to bring my ideas to reality. And I think it's the same feeling most people stuck with a career they hate feel, as well; since the only concrete skills they learned was after college, in the exact career they feel stuck with.  

College, like it or not, was my time buffer. I was best off using any remaining time, inside or outside of classes, to become useful---to develop concrete skills. 

Coincidently, that's also the advice famed entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreeseen, whose [career guide](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html) inspired me to share my experience, gives students:  

>If you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start developing concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the better...Once you get into the real world and you're primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.
>
>[...]
>
>Graduating with a technical degree [or any other useful skill] is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons.

Put another way, your first priority is not to discover what you like, as most school counselors will tell you; your first priority is to become useful. 

Passion is invigorating, but more often than not, it is used to fuels excuses. 
Passion is nothing more than a present inclination. Focus on it too early on and it'll only serve to disguise your fears and prevent you from embracing the very hard work that makes you useful.

Using my experience with psychology as an example: by itself, psychology is just interesting bits of knowledge that anyone can learn, and most do enjoy learning. Much less people are willing to put in the hours of difficult, deep work required to become decent writers, or speakers, or programmers. But only in that way can you bring your study of psychology to life through stories like [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell); or in seminars like [Tony Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins); or through an app like [Stickk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StickK). 

The approach, as I've come to see it, is to not rely on passion, or college for that matter. Through whatever means, and as early as you can, develop a base of one to two concrete skills that can be useful anywhere, and that are especially useful to your present inclinations. That way, when you touch base with the specific domain that resonates with you---call it your passion if you like---you'll be ready with the ability to package everything together into your own gift of expertise.
