Till this day, I remember the first time my mom talked to my brothers and me about college. She summoned all four of us to the living room for another "family meeting." We see her enter the room with four bulky, crimson folders, eagerly staring at us. 

“This is what you need to get into Harvard!” she says.

My brothers and I stared at her blankly. We were still in middle school. What could she possibly mean? It wasn't until we opened the folders that we realized: she had printed out the Harvard admissions page.

"A little too much time on your hands, mom?" I said, flipping through the pages.

“Sure mom. That easy," my brother Juan said. He pointed at the acceptance rate, which read 6.8%.

Despite our ensuing remarks, our mother insisted. So we amused her and took the folders. Meeting adjourned, the first of many.

That day, as we laughed at her for believing in us, never would I have expected she'd prove us wrong. That such an accomplishment was in our reach if we prepared. But, five years later, my brother Juan was accepted into Harvard.

His achievement redefined my beliefs of what I thought possible. I started asking, Why couldn't have my mom print out Steve Jobs’ Wikipedia page, instead? Not to say that Harvard, or any college, isn't a worthy achievement. But, unless success is guaranteed by a diploma, it is only a means to a promising life. So why college?

Sadly, we put more faith in college than we do ourselves. And the only reason I can make as to why is, we've been tricked.  

College works like one big coin trick. To make a coin disappear a magician uses pretend movements as distractions. Schools, similarly, have students moving around, from classes to meetings to parties, mimicking others, as their parent's money disappears. But as long as the student graduates with a job, everyone is happy. As if there was some special force at work that made it happen.

Reality is, there's nothing special about college that, with less debt and more discipline, you couldn't learn another way. Imagine where many young, intelligent, ambitious young people would be if, instead of cramming for exams and fixing up their resume, they invested that effort into the real world. (There are, of course, a few outliers that already give us a hint of what’s possible.)

That's not to imply that I'm against going to college. But as much as it can help us succeed, it can also hinder us by placing limits in our beliefs. We enter college with the idea that we can't succeed without it. So we start to do only what is necessary to succeed in that bubble of our existence. We stop working on side projects we are passionate about. We determine our future based on the decision of an admissions officer and the GPA on a piece of paper. Slowly, we stop believing in ourselves.

Don't let the college dream become an illusion. Whether the trick works or fails, the final outcome depends on you.
