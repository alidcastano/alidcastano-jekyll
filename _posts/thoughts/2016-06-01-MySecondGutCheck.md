Repeatedly, in the last few years, I’ve turned to the same folder in my Evernote, and written on the same topic in my Moleskine. Like all the stuff we keep packed away and hidden in the attic, I continued to shelve away each idea, and with it, the feeling the idea stirred inside me. I figured I’d use the idea later, and the feeling would still be there.

In *ScrewTape Letters*, C.S. Lewis warns about such passive habits: “The more often he feels without acting, the less he will be able ever to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel.” 

Indeed, there's a stack of ideas, a feeling, a project, I must bring back to life; or better said, I need the project to bring me back to life---so that I can feel again. 

I want to feel the same aliveness I felt in 2012; the year my brother and I started Castano Fitness.

For the first 21 years or so, for most people, life is just school---class, homework, and the occasional weekend. But perhaps you've had a hobby, or a relationship, something that shook up that repetitive rhythm, and gave life meaning. 

That's what fitness did for me. It shook things up, gave my life an new beat; and like what Slim Shady was for Eminem, Castano Fitness became an identity that gave me the confidence to fully express myself. I started to me value my thoughts, my ideas, my work. I learned that I could use the little I knew, to help other people who knew less—and that some people even valued the advice enough to pay for it. Indeed, Castano Fitness was my first business; it gave me a taste of what it feels like to get paid to do work you love.

But then college came, and I choked. Something caused me to stop with Castano Fitness; I'm not exactly sure what. But I know the same thing happens to other people too. No one really talks about it, but I don't think it's a coincidence that you can find out more about the interests of a college student, if you ask them what they did in high school; they too, relinquished their side projects when they got to college.  

Here's what I do know. Along with the fitness notes, ideas, and aspirations that I still carry, I’ve also been carrying a bunch of excuses, fears that I accidentally picked up when I got to college. 

And here's my dilemma. I feel like I'm at the airport carrying too much weight in my bag. The life I want is about to take off, and if I want to catch it in time, I have choose: my ideas or my fears; I can't afford to carry both. 

Except, I can't just drop fear---it's a slimy sucker, stuck to every idea. I have no choice but to bring it with me, and so I'm afraid there's only one option.

I'm reminded of a story told by E.B. White. While visiting a farmer friend, White learned that the electrified fences keeping his friend's cows trapped, didn't have any current running through them. The cows learned to stay away from them the first few days, his friend explained, and after that the current wasn't necessary. "Thousands of cows are living in fear of a strand of wire that no longer has the power to confine them," White wrote. "Freedom is theirs for the asking. Rise up, cows!" 

My inaction, too, has prevented me from experiencing fear for what it is. Like the fence without current, fear is harmless, weightless---empty baggage. I just made the mistake, these last few years, of working so long in the comfort of silence, letting fear grow, giving it more weight than it deserves in my life.

Indeed, that's what makes this post hard to write---that I know I'm going to share it, and it'll be one of the few I've shared. (At least I can find solace in this form of meta writing.)

Whoever said the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step must have been a liar, or must have had some freakishly long legs. That first step, for me, has always felt more like one big, scary jump.  Either way, I'm carrying less weight with me now as I write this; I'm ready to make the leap.

With Castano Fitness, I experienced the power that one idea, not shelved away, can have. I'd like to take another one out now, and introduce you to my new project: Strive For Balance. 

More details to come soon; but you can expect this post to be one of the many I'm going to make regarding fitness. Though this one, will be the most important; because it marks the start.
