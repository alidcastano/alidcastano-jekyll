    <h1>How about a trial run?</h1>
    <p>(Sure, what do you suggest?)</p>
     I understand how crucial the first few hires are to the success of a startup. So I'd be more than willing to give the position a trial run for a few weeks to prove my ability. Any tasks or projects you need to be completed? <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=alidcastano@gmail.com" target="_blank"> Contact me</a> and I'll get them done; no strings attached.
