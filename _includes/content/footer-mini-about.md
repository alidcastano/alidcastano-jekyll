# About Alid Castano

I'm fascinated by fitness, startups, and personal growth. My core belief is that is that it is possible to succeed in every area of life, without sacrificing anything important. Here is where I get clear on how to make that happen. I write about the insights and strategies that I believe make a measurable difference in my life, and will for you as well. I don't promise I have all the answers, just a place to start.
