Notes: 


##How do you grade yourself? Do that.  

We all grade ourselves by different measures. One example is Donald Trump putting his name on every building, he cares about recognition. (Other example measures include: Money, grades, value, contribution).

Most people don't even know why they are doing what they are doing. By consequence, they spend their whole live pursuing little distractions someone else convinced them they should have (i.e. money). 

Know Your Personal Philosophy of what makes you happy and what is worth doing, and do what is honestly important to you.. Instead of what others think you should.

##No more yes. If you are not saying HELL YEAH!, say no.

(Big problem with time management = We overcommit ourselves. Rather than trying to be more productive with your time, practice letting go of needless commitments.)

The philosophy: If you feel anything less than "HELL YEAH" then say no. If you wouldn't rate an activity a 10 or 9, it's as good as being a 1. (Similarly, a maybe is just a no in disguise.) 

(Become a minimalist with your time and you leave room to do what matters most.) 


##Focus on being, not having. 

...I have something he [the billionare] will never have: "enough."

Point of doing anything is because it makes you happy. Life is about the the joy of learning and doing, not about getting it done. At the end, it's about who you want to be, not what you have.

##Obvious to you, amazing to others. 

So maybe what's obvious to me is amazing to someone else?
Everybody's ideas seem obvious to them. So maybe what's obvious to me is amazing to someone else?





3.Start now, you don't [insert excuse here].

To make something big, you need to building something useful; and for that, you don't need funding or an MBA.. or any other excuse. Ex. CD Baby started simply as a submit purchase form that would send him an email so he could mail the CD, nothing fancy (so stop procrastinating).

Fall in love with the idea of building something useful (Make something people want, as Paul Graham would say.)

*You can always start now, with 1% of vision; a humble prototype.*

Starting small puts 100% of energy on solving real problems for real people. This gives you a strong foundation to grow from and eliminates friction of big infrastructure.

(Also, an advantage of no funding:) By not having any money to waste, you never waste money. *Necessity is a great teacher.*

1. Present each idea to the world. If it is not a hit, SWITCH. 

Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not by consistently doing what is not working.

(How do you know the difference?) Creating a succesful business is like writing a hit song. You may write 100 songs,but only one song truly resonates; suddendly you've got a hit. Your not struggling to create demand, anymore. All doors open wide. 

(You can't force people to like a bad idea, no matter how good you make it. But you can convince them to fall in love with a good idea, by making it better.)

We all have lots of ideas, creations and projects. When you present one to world, and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as is... instead, get back to improving or inventing. 

*A hit = when multiple people are saying,  "Ah yeah, I need this!" Anything less than that, don't pursue it.*


6. Happiness of Customers > Survival of Company.

Well meaning companies get stuck in survival mode and lose sight of customers. Care more about benefit of customers (Like Sivers cared about muscians) than your self/company.*A Company should be willing to die for customers.*


7. Insert a human touch into your company, whenever possible. 

Human touches make people smile and remember you. It is such tiny details that thrill people enough to tell their friends about you. Ex. Instead of the usual, formal email, Sivers sent a goofy email that ended up being a huge success with customers. 

4. Proudly exclude people and you will win the hearts of the people you want.

(If you try to be everything to everyone, you end up serving no one, so...) Proudly exclude people and say what you are not. By doing that, you win the hearts of people you want. (Ex. CD baby only independent musicians, not record labels)

If your target 1% sees you excluding other 99%, then that percent will come, because you've shown how much you value them. 

9. Make your company what you want.

*Company = your utopia, a way to design your perfect world*

You don't always want your company to be big--it creates headaches. You have to deal with media, investors, etc.... Isn't happiness the goal?

Make your company as big as you want it to be (In fact, Sivers wanted his company to stay small but because of the value he provided, it grew anyway and he decided to sell it).

Make your role what you want it to be. Anything you hate, somebody else loves. Delegate the task(but don't abdicate). 


- 5 years later media said he revolutionized music business. "Revolution" is word people use after you are succesful. Before that you are just a corky person doing things differently.
- If you think true love needs to be like Romeo and Juliet, you'll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly. If you think your life purpose needs to hit you like a lighting bolt, you'll overlook the day to day things that fascinate you. - Sivers
