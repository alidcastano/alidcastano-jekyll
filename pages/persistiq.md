 I've worked with student entrepreneurs, as a speaking advisor, helping them improve their presentations and speaking skills. I believe this experience, along with my knowledge of programming and experience blogging, will prove valuable in the role of executive assistant. As a generalist, my abilities as an advisor, blogger, and developer will allow me to tackle a multitude of tasks, have a high-level understanding of a variety of problems, and work seamlessly with a diverse group of people. I learn fast, I'm ready to specialize and adapt to any necessary demands and to surpass your expectations.
