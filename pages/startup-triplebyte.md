You're seeking a smart generalist? I'm your guy. I've advised engineers on how to improve their startup pitches and can translate this experience into the interview process. I know basic programming, so I can understand engineers and prototype product ideas. I have experience with both Wordpress and Jekyll so, if you wanted, I could help setup your blog and contribute to blog posts. As an early hire, I'd be ready to learn fast and do whatever needs to get done.
