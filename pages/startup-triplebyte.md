I've advised engineers on how to improve their startup pitches and can translate this experience to the interview process. I know basic programming so I can prototype product ideas. I have experience with both Wordpress and Jekyll so, if you wanted, I could help setup your blog and contribute to blog posts. As an early hire, I'd be ready to learn fast and do whatever needs to get done.

<!-- 


I know *basic programming (I KNOW programming)

I *even can help build...  
( I CAN help you build and maintain your site)

*As an early hire, **why to put as an early hire??

(I AM READY TO DO whatever I need to do to get THINGS done.) 

**(All I want is to be a part of something great; Iâ€™d love to join you guys) I will take this last part off
