Your seeking a smart generalist? I'm your guy. I've advised engineers in how to best pitch their startup ideas and can translate this experience to interviews. I know basic programming, so I can contribute ideas and quickly prototypes them. I even help build and maintain your blog, if you like. 

As an early hire, I'd be ready to do whatever needs to get done. All I want is to be a part of something great; I'd love to join you guys.
