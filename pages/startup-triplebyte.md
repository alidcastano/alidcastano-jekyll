I've advised engineers on how to improve their startup pitches and can translate this experience into the interview process. I know basic programming, so I can understand engineers and prototype product ideas. I have experience with both Wordpress and Jekyll so, if you wanted, I could help setup your blog and contribute to blog posts. As an early hire, I'm ready to learn fast and adapt to any necessary demands. I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to surpass your expectations.
