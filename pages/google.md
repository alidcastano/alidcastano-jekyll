 I've worked with student entrepreneurs, as a speaking advisor, helping them improve their presentations and speaking skills. I believe this experience, along with my knowledge of programming and experience blogging, will prove valuable as an intern. As a generalist, my experience as an advisor, blogger, and developer will allow me to tackle a multitude of tasks, have a high-level understanding of a variety of problems, and work seamlessly with a diverse group of people. I'm ready to learn fast and adapt to any necessary demands. More than anything, I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to surpass your expectations.
