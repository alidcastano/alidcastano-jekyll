					<h3> <strong> Student at the University of Pennsylvania </strong> </h3>

					<h4> 3 skills that define me: </h4>
				</div>

		        <div class="section-description">
		          <h3><strong>Advisor</strong></h3>
		          <p> I love helping people improve. Lately, this has involved helping students improve their presentations and speaking skills. I had my first two paid speaking gigs on November 2015, with the <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center's</a> Youth Fostering Change (YFC) and Juveniles for Justice (J4J) programs.  </p>


		          <h3><strong>Developer</strong></h3>
		          <p>I decided to learn how to code after reading Paul Graham's advice, "<a href="http://alidcastano.com/you-are-here-now">Stay Upwind</a>". Since then, I've taken Computer Science courses at Penn and self-taught myself frond end. I haven't created any awesome projects, yet. But I've prototyped a project idea,<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html"> Studbits</a> (excuse the mess), and, more recently, put together this responsive resume. My Stack: HTML/CSS, Sass/Bourbon/Neat, Foundation, Javascript, Ruby (in progress).
		          </p>

		          <h3><strong>Blogger</strong></h3>
		          <p>I have experience working with both Wordpress and Jekyll. I  recently started my blog from scratch with Jekyll, because I prefered its simplicity and wanted to blog like a hacker. Nonetheless, I have experience working with both blogging platforms. If you'd like an idea of who I am and how I write, I'd love it if you read: <a href="http://alidcastano.com/you-are-here-now"> You are where you need to be.</a>

					<h4> 2 roles I've learned from: </h4>
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<img src="/img/cwic-logo.jpg" alt="upenn job" class="resume-image">
					<h3> <strong>Speaking Advisor</strong>, CWiC</h3>
					<p> I've worked as an affiliated advisor for an Engineering Entreprenuership course and advised students on how to improve their presentation skills and pitch to investors. I've taught workshops with 25+ students on communication anxiety, organization, visual aids, and other topics. And I've helped schedule and conduct interviews for applicants interested in becoming new advisors. </p>

					<img src="/img/meno-logo.png" alt="first startup" class="resume-image">
					<h3><strong>Project Manager</strong>, Meno  </h3>
					<p> I was tired of asking, "What's good here?" at restaurants. So I, along with two other team members, created Meno, an app that helps users to discover the best menu options wherever they go. Ultimately, the venture failed. But the experience taught me how to implement a bplan and how to pitch to investors. And, most importantly, as my team split apart, I learned the importance of having the right qualities in a founding team.</p>

				<div class="section-intro">
					<h4> 1 fun fact about me: </h4>
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<img src="/img/quadruplet.jpg" alt="fun fact" class="resume-image-med">
					<h3> <strong> I'm a quadruplet </strong></h3>
					<p> Essentially, I've been working in a small team dynamic since birth. In highschool, for example, my brothers and I held the four top positions in Student Government. "The Castano Dictatorship," students called it.</p>

			<div class="resume"> 
				<div class="trial-run">
					<h1> How about a trial run? </h1>
					<p> I understand how crucial the first few hires are to the success a startup. If you have any sense of uncertainty, I'd be more than willing to give the position a trial run for a few weeks to prove my ability. If you have any tasks or projects you need completed, contact me and I'll get them done; no strings attached.
