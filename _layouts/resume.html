					<h4> 3 skills that define me: </h4>
				</div>

		        <div class="section-description">
		          <h3><strong>Advisor</strong></h3>
		          <p> I was certified as a speaking advisor in May 2015. Since then, I've worked with student entreprenuers on how to improve their startup pitches. And I've had my first two paid speaking gigs, in November 2015, with the <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center's</a> Youth Fostering Change (YFC) and Juveniles for Justice (J4J) programs.  </p>


		          <h3><strong>Developer</strong></h3>
		          <p>I decided to learn how to code on January 2015. Since then, I've learned the fundamentals of programming at my school and self-taught myself front end. I haven't made any awesome projects, yet. But I've prototyped a project idea,<a href="http://studbits.bitballoon.com/demo-webclip"> Studbits</a> (excuse the mess), and, more recently, put together this responsive resume. 
		          <br>
		          My Stack: <br>
		          HTML/CSS, Sass/Bourbon/Neat, Javascript, Ruby (in progress) 
		          </p>

		          <h3><strong>Blogger</strong></h3>
		          <p>  I've been blogging since July 2015. I started with Wordpress, but, recently, started my blog again, from scratch, with Jekyll, because I prefered its simplicity over Wordpress. But I have experience with both. If you'd like an idea of who I am and how I write, here is my favorite post: <a href="http://alidcastano.com/you-are-here-now"> You are where you need to be.</a>

				<div class="section-intro">
					<h4> 2 roles I've learned from: </h4>
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<img src="/img/cwic-logo.jpg" alt="upenn job" class="resume-image">
					<h3> <strong>Speaking Advisor</strong>, CWiC</h3>
					<p> Primarily, I'm worked as an affiliated advisor for an Engineering Entreprenuership course and advised students on how to improve their presentation skills and pitch to investors. I've also taught workshops with rooms of 25+ students on how to control communication anxiety and improve presentation skills. </p>

					<img src="/img/meno-logo.png" alt="first startup" class="resume-image">
					<h3><strong>Co-founder & CEO</strong>, Meno  </h3>
					<p> I was tired of asking, "What's good here?" at restaurants. So I, along with two other team members, created Meno, an app that helps users to discover the best menu options wherever they go. </p>
					<p> Ultimately, the venture failed. But I'm proud of the experience. I learned how to implement a bplan and pitch to investors, and to not focus on that more than the product and customers. And, most importantly, as my team split apart, I learned the importance of having the right qualities in a founding team.</p>

					<h4> 1 fun fact about me: </h4>
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<img src="/img/quadruplet.jpg" alt="fun fact" class="resume-image-med">
					<h3> <strong> I'm a quadruplet. </strong></h3>
					<p> I have three brothers who are the same age as me.</p>

				<div class="trial-run">
					<h1> How about a trial run? </h1>
					<p> I understand how crucial the first few hires are to the success a startup. If you have any sense of uncertainty, I'd be more than willing to give the position a trial run for a few weeks to prove my ability. If you have any tasks or projects you need completed, contact me and I'll get it done; no strings attached.
