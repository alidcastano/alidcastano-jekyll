					<h4> 3 skills that define me: </h4>
				</div>

		        <div class="section-description">
		          <h3><strong>Advisor</strong></h3>
		          <p> I've been trained and certified as a speaking advisor, since May 2015. I've advised student entreprenuers on how to improve their presentations. And I had my first two paid speaking gig last year, November 2015, with the <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center's</a> Youth Fostering Change (YFC) and Juveniles for Justice (J4J) programs.  </p>


		          <h3><strong>Developer</strong></h3>
		          <p>I decided to learn how to code on January 2015. Since then, I've learned back end through my school and taught myself front end. I haven't made any awesome projects, yet. But I've prototyped a project idea,<a href="http://studbits.bitballoon.com/demo-webclip"> Studbits</a> (first time, excuse the mess), and, more recently, put together this site. My Stack: HTML/CSS, Sass/Bourbon/Neat, Javascript, Ruby (in progress). 
		          </p>

		          <h3><strong>Blogger</strong></h3>
		          <p>  I've been blogging since July 2015. Recently, however, I started from scratch with Jekyll, I prefered its simplicity over Wordpress. But I have experience with both. If you'd like an idea of who I am and how I write, here is my favorite post: <a href="http://alidcastano.com/here-now"> Is it their fault, or yours? </a>

				<div class="section-intro">
					<h4> 2 roles I've learned from: </h4>
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<img src="/img/cwic-logo.jpg" alt="upenn job" class="resume-image">
					<h3> <strong>Speaking Advisor</strong>, CWiC</h3>
					<p> Primarily, I'm worked as an affiliated advisor for an Engineering Entreprenuership course and advised students on how to improve their presentation skills and pitch to investors. I've also taught workshops with rooms of 25+ students on how to control communication anxiety and improve presentation skills. </p>

					<img src="/img/meno-logo.png" alt="first startup" class="resume-image">
					<h3><strong>Co-founder & CEO</strong>, Meno  </h3>
					<p> I was tired of asking, "What's good here?" at restaurants. So I, along with two other team members, created Meno, an app that helps users to discover the best menu options wherever they go. </p>
					<p> Ultimately, the venture failed. But I'm proud of the experience. I learned how to implement a bplan and pitch to investors, and to not focus on that more than the product and customers. And, most importantly, as my team split apart, I learned the importance of having the right qualities in a founding team.</p>
