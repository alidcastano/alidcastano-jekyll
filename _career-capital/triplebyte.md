I genuinely care about helping people find a meaningful place to contribute and make an impact, based on ability and not other skewed measures. 
I've advised engineers on how to improve their speaking skills and can translate this experience into the interview process. I also have basic knowledge of programming and experience blogging, which makes me capable of serving many roles. Because of all this, I believe I can be of value to your mission and would like to express interest in joining your team.
