I'm blown away by the fact that, come May 16th, startup investments will be legal to everyone. I'd love to contribute in any way that I can. I've advised engineers on how to improve their speaking skills and can translate this experience into the founder interview process. I also have basic knowledge of programming and experience blogging, so I can help with anything from testing landing pages to writing startup stories. Because of all this, I believe I can be of value to your mission, in making capitalism accessible to everyone.
