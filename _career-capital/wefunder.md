I'm blown away by the fact that, come May 16th, startup investments will be legal to everyone. I'd love to join you guys and be a part of making this happen. I've advised engineers on how to improve their speaking skills and can translate this experience into the founder interview process. I also have basic knowledge of programming and experience blogging, so I can help with anything from testing landing pages to writing startup stories. Plus, as a fitness enthusiast, my survival skill is contagious vitality; I help ensure everyone is performing at their best, physically and mentally.
