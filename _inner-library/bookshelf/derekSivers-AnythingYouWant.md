thoughts: |
    My favorite book on entrepreneurship. A short read, packed with profound insights from Siver's experience starting his first business, CD Baby. 
    His story serves as a proof that you can do things your own way and as a side effect, still be successful--and more fulfilled.

    "If you think true love needs to be like Romeo and Juliet, you'll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly. If you think your life purpose needs to hit you like a lighting bolt, you'll overlook the day to day things that fascinate you." - Derek Sivers

# !! how do you grade yourself? 

# $$ know your personal philosophy of what makes you happy

== 

We all grade ourselves by different measures. One example: Donald Trump putting his name on every building, because he cares about recognition. (Other measures include: money, grades, value, contribution).

Most people don't even know why they are doing what they are doing. By consequence, they spend their whole live pursuing little distractions someone else convinced them they should have (i.e. money). 

Know your personal philosophy of what makes you happy and what is worth doing, and do what is honestly important to you.. instead of what others think you should.

# !! if you are not saying HELL YEAH!, say no

# $$ anything commitment you'd rate less than a 10 or 9, is a 1 in disguise

==

(Big problem with time management = we over commit ourselves. Rather than trying to be more productive with your time, let go of unnecessary commitments.)

The philosophy: If you feel anything less than "HELL YEAH" then say no. If you wouldn't rate an activity a 10 or 9, it's as good as being a 1. (A "maybe" is just a "no" in disguise.) 

(Become a minimalist with your time--leave room to do what matters most.)

# !! focus on being, not having

"...I have something he [the billionaire] will never have: enough."

The point of doing anything is because it makes you happy. Life is about the the joy of learning and doing, not about getting it done. 

At the end, it's about who you want to be, not what you have.

You already have enough.

# !! what seems obvious to you, may be amazing to others 

==

Everybody's ideas seem obvious to them. 

When we talk to someone else we think, "“I never would have thought of that. How do they even come up with that? It's genius!"

Maybe what seems obvious to me seems amazing to someone else. (Curse of Knowledge.)

# !! start now, you don't need [insert excuse here]

# $$ a humble prototype 
==

To make something big, you need to building something useful; and for that, you don't need funding or an MBA.. or any other excuse. 

Ex. CD Baby started simply as a submit purchase form that would send him an email so he could mail the CD, nothing fancy.

Fall in love with the idea of building something useful (Make something people want, as Paul Graham would say.)

*You can always start now, with 1% of vision; a humble prototype.*

Starting small puts 100% of energy on solving real problems for real people 
= strong foundation to grow from.

(Also, an advantage of no funding:) By not having any money to waste, you never waste money. *Necessity is a great teacher.*

“Revolution” is a term that people use only when you're successful. Before that, you're just a quirky person who does things differently.

# !! present each idea to the world. If it is not a hit, SWITCH

# $$ creating a successful business is like writing a hit song 

==

Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not by consistently doing what is not working.

Creating a successful business is like writing a hit song. You may write 100 songs,but only one song truly resonates; suddenly you've got a hit. Your not struggling to create demand, anymore. All doors open wide. 

(You can't force people to like a bad idea, no matter how good you make it. But you can convince them to fall in love with a good idea, by making it better.)

We all have lots of ideas, creations and projects. When you present one to world, and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as is... instead, get back to improving or inventing. 

*A hit = when multiple people are saying,  "Ah yeah, I need this!" Anything less than that, don't pursue it.*

# !! proudly exclude people and you will win the hearts of the people you want

==

(If you try to be everything to everyone, you end up serving no one, so...) 

Proudly exclude people and say what you are not. By doing that, you win the hearts of people you want. (Ex. CD baby only independent musicians, not record labels.)

If your *target 1% sees you excluding other 99%*, then that percent will come, because you've shown how much you value them.

# !! happiness of customers > survival of company

== 

Well meaning companies get stuck in survival mode and lose sight of customers. Care more about benefit of customers (Like Sivers cared about musicians) than your self/company.

*A Company should be willing to die for customers.*

---

# !! insert a human touch into your company

==

Human touches make people smile and remember you. Those tiny details are what thrill people enough to tell their friends about you. 

Ex. Instead of the usual, formal email, Sivers sent a goofy email that ended up being a huge success with customers.

# !! your startup = your utopia -- design your perfect world

==

*Company = your utopia, a way to design your perfect world*

You don't always want your company to be big--it creates headaches. You have to deal with media, investors, etc.... Isn't happiness the goal?

*Business is not about money. It's about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.*

Make your company as big as you want it to be (in fact, Sivers wanted his company to stay small but because of the value he provided, it grew anyway).

Make your role what you want it to be. Anything you hate, somebody else loves. Delegate the task (but don't abdicate).
