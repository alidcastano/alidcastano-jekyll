    The most useful career advice I've read. The advice seems obvious upon reflection, yet it is easily forgotten among all the "follow your passion" dogma.  Before you drop everything to pursue your passion, read this--I'm glad I did. (Only criticism: very repetitive--I recommend the audio version.)

    "Don't follow your passion but let your passion follow you <br>
    in your quest to become really good at what you do" <br>

# !! how do people end up loving what they do? 

# $$ skill trumps passion--let your passion follow you 

==

Need to be good at something before you can expect a good job--rare and valuable demand each other.

(Schools skip over this, they make you think it's about getting good grades and joining clubs.)

Passion mindset: "Who am I" / "what do I truly love" -- impossible to answer, keeps you confused about what to do with life

Trying to judge things in abstract before you do them.. hard to predict in advance what you'll eventually grow to love

Passion hypothesis is misconstrued. "Do what Steve jobs did not what he said."

*Passion is rare.* Messy path is the rule - things happen in stages

Science of passion:

1. Career passions are rare (most "passions" are hobby style interest)
2. Passion takes time (more experience person had, more they loved work)

Don't be in a rush to start your life..*just be the best at whatever it is your doing now*.

"Let passion follow you"

# !! craftsman mindset > passion mindset

# $$ become so good they can't ignore you 
==

Put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can't ignore you.

Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you'll build a compelling career.

If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset ("what can the world offer me?" -- *false entitlement*) and instead adopt the craftsman mindset ("what can I offer the world?").

Don't focus on details - focus on getting better, focus on quality of what you produce

*"Fight cloud of external distractions"*

# !! what traits define great work? 

# $$ creativity, impact, control 
== 

Build up rare and valuable skills

SDT (needs)
1. autonomy
2. competence
3. relatedness

Traits that define great work:

1. Creativity (push boundaries)
2. Impact (change lives)
3. Control (no one tells you what to do)

Disqualifying traits
1. Few opportunities for recognition (can't build skill)
2. Focus on something you think is useless/bad
3. Work with people you dislike
( could build career capital but persistence is hard)

Job (pay bills) - career (increasingly better work) - calling (part of life)

# !! deliberate practice 

==

*"If I stuck with it id be pretty good at it - anyone who does something for 40 years is pretty good at it"* - Steve Martin

Excellence = lifetime accumulation of deliberate practice (become comfortable with mental discomfort)

1. Strain (stretch abilities)
2. Feedback 
3. Clear goals
4. Stretch and destroy (vs mindless fun)
5. Be patient (diligence)

Accumulate massive practice (10 year rule - 10,000 hour rule). 

Examples: Bill gates attend first high school with computers, Mozart's dad was a music fanatic etc.

Not just how long but *type* of work matters. Serious study--stretch abilities with immediate feedback.

Outside of arts and sports, not as obvious and no clear training philosophy 
(ex. knowledge worker).

Choose projects where you can show work to others (scrutiny is important--humiliation is necessary to get better)

Winner take all (one type - content) vs auction market (seek open gates)

Skill acquisition - hard to start from scratch in new field - easy to switch track and leverage skill

Stretch yourself day after day , month after month.

# !! build capital first, then embrace control 

# $$ law of financial viability 

==

Don't embrace control without capital, be good at what you do first (before you make bid for control make sure you have career capital to back you up)

*If you pivot, leverage your strengths/skills* (don't just try to be brave and follow your passion without any career capital)

*Law of financial viability* - (mental algorithm) do what people are willing to pay for--money is indicator of value.

The more career capital you have, the more control you have over your life.
