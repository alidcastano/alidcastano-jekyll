# !! what is Stoicism?

# $$ practical philosophy -- Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca

== 

Definition: *"The endurance of pain or hardship without a display of feelings and without complaint"*

Tim's Intro: "Fortunately, there are a few philosophical systems designed to produce dramatic real-world effects without the nonsense. Unfortunately, they get punished because they lack the ambiguity required for weeks of lectures and expensive textbooks....found it [Stoicism] to be a simple and immensely practical set of rules for better results with less effort." 

Stoicism Purpose = *practical application* (built for action)...meditative technique that transforms negative emotions into a sense of calm and perspective.....tool that we can use to become better entrepreneurs, better friends, and better people...

The Stoics were writing honestly, often self-critically, about how they could become better people, be happier, and deal with the problems they faced.

Three principle leaders: *Marcus Aurelius* (emperor of the Roman Empire, the most powerful man on earth, sat down each day to write himself notes about restraint, compassion and humility), *Epictetus* (endured the horrors of slavery to found his own School where he taught many of Rome’s greatest minds), *Seneca* (when Nero turned on him and demanded his suicide, could think only of comforting his wife and friends).

*"Virture is sufficient for happiness"*

Marcus Aurelius said, “So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature and what I do by my own."

# !! practice what you fear, i.e., misfortune 

# $$ comfort is worst kind of slavery -- always be ready for adversity 

== 

*Comfort is the worst kind of slavery* because you’re always afraid that something or someone will take it away. But if you can not just anticipate but practice misfortune, then chance loses its ability to disrupt your life...
*live* misfortune (not just think about it)

Ex. Montaigne - ancient drinking game where the members took turns holding up a painting of a corpse inside a coffin and cheered “Drink and be merry for when you’re dead you will look like this.”

Emotions like anxiety and fear have their roots in uncertainty and rarely in experience...The solution is to do something about that ignorance. *Make yourself familiar with the things, the worst-case scenarios*, that you’re afraid of.

Practice what you fear, whether a simulation in your mind or in real-life.

Epictetus said, “life is hard, brutal, punishing, narrow, and confining, a deadly business.”

relevant quotes: 

>“It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times; while fortune is bestowing favors on it is then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs.” -Seneca

>“Show me a man who isn’t a slave; one who is a slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition; all are slaves to hope or fear. I could show you a man who has been a Consul who is a slave to his ‘little old woman’, a millionaire who is the slave of a little girl in domestic service. And there is no state of slavery more disgraceful than one which is self-imposed." 
- Seneca 

> “Cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity and always take full note of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going to do everything that is in her power.” - Seneca

# !! train perception to avoid the good and bad  

# $$ flip the obstacle upside down -- turn problem into opportunity 

== 

If you can properly turn a problem upside down, every “bad” becomes a new source of good.

Ex. trying to help someone and they respond by being surly or unwilling to cooperate = directing you towards new virtues, i.e, patience/understanding 

To the Stoic, everything is opportunity. 

relevant quotes: 

>“Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions—-not outside.” -Marcus Aurelius

>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” -Marcus Aurelius

>“Choose not to be harmed and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed and you haven’t been.” -Marcus Aurelius

# !! keep ego manageable and in perspective 

# $$ don't dwell on pain or cling to ephemeral happiness 

==

Remember that achievements can be ephemeral, and that your possession of them is for just an instant. Learn from Alexander’s mistake (got into fight with friend and accidentally killed). Be humble and honest and aware. That is something you can have every single day of your life.

Marcus Aurelius simple remedy: “Run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend…or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.”

..*Not dwelling on pain and not clinging to ephemeral happiness*. Enjoy it to the fullest, but don’t expect it to last forever, nor expect some single point in time to make your entire life complete forever.

*We’re all addicts in some respect, and we can all experience that same freedom.*

relevant quotes: 

>“Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both.” -Marcus Aurelius

>“So-and-so’s son is dead
What happened?
His son is dead
Nothing else?
Not a thing.
>
>So-and-so’s ship sank
What happened?
His ship sank.
>
>So-and-so was carted off to prison.
What happened?
He was carted off to prison.
>-But if we now add to this “He has had bad luck,” then each of us is adding this observation on his own account” - Epictetus
