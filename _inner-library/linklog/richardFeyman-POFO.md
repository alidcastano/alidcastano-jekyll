# !! [28:24] out of complexity, simplicity appears 

==

"When you discover new things, appears on the whole to be more complicated because we learn about a greater experience... [Then] every once in a while we have these *integrations in which everything's pulled together into a unification*, in which it turns out to be simpler than it looked before."

# !! [38:20] concept of active irresponsibility

== 

putting ideas together as shaky as building deck of cards, explains concept of active irresponsibility to minimize/eliminate interruptions

*"Let George do it" - "I want to do my physics"*

(similar to Cal Newport's belief in the necessity of 
[deep work](/books/DeepWork) and 
Derek Siver's philosophy for time management 
["Hell yeah!" or no](/books/AnythingYouWant).)

# !! [:40:00] have no philosophy for teaching, i.e., try everything

==

philosophy for teaching: have no philosophy; be chaotic--use every possible way of doing it 

example of teaching his son versus his daughter (different hooks to catch different kinds of minds/interests)
