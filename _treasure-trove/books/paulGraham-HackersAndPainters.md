# !! Why nerds are unpopular

# $$ popularity is a full time commitment 

==

Being smart seems to make you unpopular.

**Nerds serve two masters**. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. **And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time**, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.

>“No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.” - Leon Battista Alberti

Teenagers are always on duty as conformists… Likewise, popular isn’t just something you are or you aren’t, but something you make yourself.

**The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about.** Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties.

Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or siblings of popular kids, they’ll tend to become nerds.

Important thing about the real world is not that it’s populated by adults, but that it’s very large, and the things you do have real effects. That’s what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. **The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect**.

nerds didn’t fit in because they were step ahead, already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world (Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing the wrong size shoes.)

**Teenagers are driven crazy by the life they’re made to lead.** Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.

In almost any group of people you’ll find hierarchy. When groups of adults form in the real world, it’s generally for some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.

**The important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life**.

**Relentlessness wins** because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible….All those unseen details combine to produce something that’s just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune.

# !! What you can't say---and why? 

# $$ Conformist Test

# $$ viso sciolto, pensieri stretti 

# $$ attack from a distance -- meta labels, metaphor, humor

==

Nerds are always getting in trouble. They say improper things for the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas. Convention has less hold over them.

**The Conformist Test**: do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?

The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. **I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true.**


How to find out what we're getting wrong?  

1. Keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?
2. Follow that word, heresy. 
3. Look at what used to be acceptable and is now unthinkable
4.  Compare cultural ideas (what's harmless somewhere else but taboo here)
5.  Look at how taboos are created and why they are adopted (you'll likely see power struggles where you’ll find **a group powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them**)

**Great work tends to grow out of ideas that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that’s unthinkable.**

Stretch your thoughts to think the unthinkable: Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages beyond the thoughts themselves. It’s like stretching...If you can think things so outside the box that they’d make people’s hair stand on end, you’ll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that people call innovative.

When to say what you can't say? **Pick your battles**...If your aim in life is to rehabilitate the color yellow, that may be what you want. But if you’re mostly interested in other questions, being labeled as a yellowist will just be a distraction.

> “i pensieri stretti & il viso sciolto.” 

**Closed thoughts and an open face. Smile at everyone, and don’t tell them what you’re thinking.**

>Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.

**The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want. And if you feel you have to say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking improper thoughts.**

Perhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don’t agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but not to be too specific about what you disagree with... if they ask, are you with us or against us? Answer "neither"; or better, "I haven't decided."

...you want to avoid directly engaging the main body of the enemy’s troops. Better to harass them with arrows from a distance.

1. **Attack labels with meta-labels** — ratchet the debate up one level of abstraction. (Ex. If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being accused of whatever heresy is contained in the book or film that someone is trying to censor.)

2. **Attack with metaphor.** (Ex. Arthur Mille and The Crucible, about the Salem witch trials.)

3. **Attack with humor.** Zealots, whatever their cause, invariably lack a sense of humor. They can’t reply in kind to jokes. They’re as unhappy on the territory of humor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.

#### Always Be Questioning. 

Ask anyone, and they’ll say the same thing: they’re pretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really wrong. In other words, everything is OK except things that aren’t.

If a statement is false, it shouldn’t be suppressed. So when you see statements being attacked as x-ist or y-ic, sign that something is wrong. 

You need to be able to watch your own thoughts from a distance...recognize and discount effects of moral fashions.

How can you see the wave, when you’re the water? Always be questioning. That’s the only defense. **What can’t you say? And why?**
