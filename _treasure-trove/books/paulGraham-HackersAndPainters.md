### why nerds are unpopular


---

# !! popularity is a full time commitment 

==

Being smart seems to make you unpopular.

**Nerds serve two masters**. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. **And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time**, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.

>“No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.” - Leon Battista Alberti

Teenagers are always on duty as conformists… Likewise, popular isn’t just something you are or you aren’t, but something you make yourself.

**The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about.** Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties.

Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or siblings of popular kids, they’ll tend to become nerds.

---

# !! bubbles of existences with local effect 

==

Important thing about the real world is not that it’s populated by adults, but that it’s very large, and the things you do have real effects. That’s what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. **The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect**.

nerds didn’t fit in because they were step ahead, already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world (Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing the wrong size shoes.)

**Teenagers are driven crazy by the life they’re made to lead.** Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.

In almost any group of people you’ll find hierarchy. When groups of adults form in the real world, it’s generally for some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.

**The important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life**.

# !! the conformist test

==


Nerds are always getting in trouble. They say improper things for the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas. Convention has less hold over them.

**The Conformist Test**: do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?

The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. **I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true.**

---

# !! how to find out what you're getting wrong? 

== 

**Great work tends to grow out of ideas that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that’s unthinkable.**


1. Keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?
2. Follow that word, heresy. 
3. Look at what used to be acceptable and is now unthinkable
4.  Compare cultural ideas (what's harmless somewhere else but taboo here)
5.  Look at how taboos are created and why they are adopted (you'll likely see power struggles where you’ll find **a group powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them**)



---

# !! stretch your thoughts to think unthinkable

# $$ viso sciolto, pensieri stretti 

==

**Stretch your thoughts to think the unthinkable:** Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages beyond the thoughts themselves. It’s like stretching...If you can think things so outside the box that they’d make people’s hair stand on end, you’ll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that people call innovative.

When to say what you can't say? **Pick your battles**...If your aim in life is to rehabilitate the color yellow, that may be what you want. But if you’re mostly interested in other questions, being labeled as a yellowist will just be a distraction.

> “i pensieri stretti & il viso sciolto.” 

**Closed thoughts and an open face. Smile at everyone, and don’t tell them what you’re thinking.**

>Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.

**The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want. And if you feel you have to say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking improper thoughts.**

---

# !! attack from a distance

# $$ meta labels, metaphor, humor

==

Perhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don’t agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, **but not to be too specific about what you disagree with**... if they ask, are you with us or against us? Answer "neither"; or better, "I haven't decided."

...you want to avoid directly engaging the main body of the enemy’s troops. Better to harass them with arrows from a distance.

1. **Attack labels with meta-labels** — ratchet the debate up one level of abstraction. (Ex. If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being accused of whatever heresy is contained in the book or film that someone is trying to censor.)

2. **Attack with metaphor.** (Ex. Arthur Mille and The Crucible, about the Salem witch trials.)

3. **Attack with humor.** Zealots, whatever their cause, invariably lack a sense of humor. They can’t reply in kind to jokes. They’re as unhappy on the territory of humor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.

---

# !! always be questioning

# $$ what can’t you say? And why?

==

Ask anyone, and they’ll say the same thing: they’re pretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really wrong. In other words, everything is OK except things that aren’t.

If a statement is false, it shouldn’t be suppressed. So when you see statements being attacked as x-ist or y-ic, sign that something is wrong. 

You need to be able to watch your own thoughts from a distance...recognize and discount effects of moral fashions.

How can you see the wave, when you’re the water? Always be questioning. That’s the only defense.

# !! what is a hacker?

==

In the popular press, “hacker” means someone who breaks into computers. Among programmers it means a good programmer. But the two meanings are connected. To programmers, “hacker” connotes mastery in the most literal sense: **someone who can make a computer do what he wants — whether the computer wants to or not**.

Believe it or not, the two senses of “hack” are also connected. **Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules**

Hackers are unruly. That is the essence of hacking. And it is also the essence of American-ness. It is no accident that Silicon Valley is in America, and not France, or Germany, or England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside the lines.

It says a great deal about our work that **we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution**. When we cook one up we’re not always 100% sure which kind it is. But as long as it has the right sort of wrongness, that’s a promising sign. **It’s odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical. Computers are precise and methodical. Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.**

/**

### the other road ahead

**\

---

# !! execute on ideas 

# $$ shelfing an idea costs you double

==

Have you ever noticed that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end up in it are ones you thought of while writing? The same thing happens with software. **Working to implement one idea gives you more ideas. So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in implementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would have led to.**

Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf. When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them.

---

# !! what matters is paying close attention (not moving slowly)

# $$ e.g. navy pilot

== 

**And paying attention is more important to reliability than moving slowly.** Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot can land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can cut a bagel.

Those few people work very hard, and technology magnifies the effect of the decisions they make. If they win, they win big.

/**

**There are only two things you have to know about business: build something users love, and make more than you spend.**

**\

---

# !! start lean

# $$ build something you want and listen to users as you improve

== 

If you’re a hacker who has thought of one day starting a startup, there are probably two things keeping you from doing it. One is that you don’t know anything about business. The other is that you’re afraid of competition. Neither of these fences have any current in them. 

**There are only two things you have to know about business: build something users love, and make more than you spend.** If you get these two right, you’ll be ahead of most startups. You can figure out the rest as you go.


**Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to use yourself**. Get a version 1.0 out fast, then continue to improve the software, listening closely to users as you do. The customer is always right, but different customers are right about different things; the least sophisticated users show you what you need to simplify and clarify, and the most sophisticated tell you what features you need to add.

The best thing software can be is easy, but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limit users’ choices.

### how to make wealth 

Startups 

The Proposition Economically, **you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years**. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four.

# !! money is not wealth 

# $$ business make wealth - something people want

# $$ pie fallacy 

==

Wealth is not the same thing as money. Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.

**Money is a way of moving wealth** (anything rare and portable)... But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting,talking about making money can make it harder to understand how to make money. Money is a side effect of specialization.

Money = shorthand for whatever people want. **What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want**.

**The Pie Fallacy**: retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There might be fixed amount of money in household but you can always make more wealth

The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.


---

# !! measurement and leverage

# $$ smallness = measurement

# $$ technology = leverage / barriers of entry 

# $$ users = measure of performance 

== 

**To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.**

(e.g. CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes)

A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside

### smallness = measurement

If you can’t measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.

Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one’s boss

>**A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers.** Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don’t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.

Success or failure of a startup depends on the first employees.**Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select.** You don’t want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an **all-star team**.

### technology = leverage 

Technology = technique. It’s the way we all do things. **And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it**.

e.g. Florentines in 1200  = fine woven cloth; Dutch in 1600 = shipbuilding 

e.g. A McDonald’s franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. 

>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Via web one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. **Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.**

**Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice.**

barriers to entry---how hard would this be for someone else to develop? 



### users 

>**startup is like a mosquito**. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito. Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.

**Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users**.

>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that’s what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale.

/**

### mind the gap

**\

---

# !! like it or not, making money is a skill

==

When people care enough about something to do it well, **those who do it best tend to be far better than everyone else. There’s a huge gap**.

Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very specialized skill. But for some reason we treat this skill differently.

---

# !! why is making money not seen as skill? 

# $$ daddy model of wealth

# $$ stolen fortunes throughout most of history

# $$ lever of technology 

==

three reasons we treat making money as different: **the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society**. As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false.

1. **The Daddy Model of Wealth:** 

money is something you have to create, not something that’s distributed by Daddy. And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it’s not made equally.

**The root cause of variation in income, as Occam’s Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every other human skill.** In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about 100 times as much as the average person...In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills. And that’s without considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology.

*Are they really worth 100 to us?*These things don’t scale linearly. Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and determination of an ordinary person. **But it makes all the difference that it’s concentrated in one individual.**

Under/overpaid work. Free market determined by what buyers want... It’s lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but "unjust"? That seems like saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.

2. **Stealing It:** 

for most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding; in agricultural societies by appropriating others’ estates in times of war, and taxing them in times of peace.

started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.

3. **The Lever of Technology**

Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor? It will certainly **increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive**. That’s the whole point of technology.

Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps...**thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average person**.

The only thing technology can’t cheapen is brand. Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it. **Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.** But what label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus not having it. In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year or brand it was. If you had one, you were rich...Now even the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we’re so well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially expensive ones.

Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway. It’s not just social pressure that makes them; **idleness is lonely and demoralizing**.

>**Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor, not increasing it. If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he’d think communism had won.** Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics. Everything would seem exactly as he’d predicted, until he looked at their bank accounts. Oops.

---

# !! variations in income are a sign of health 

# $$ suppress income (stealing or taxes), suppress progress

==

Alternative to the axiom: that in a modern society, **increasing variation in income is a sign of health**. Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If we don’t see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren’t doing it, or (c) that they aren’t getting paid for it.

Will people create wealth if they can’t get paid for it? Only if it’s fun...All the un fun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society that confiscates private fortunes.

e.g. Northern Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it). Northern Italy in 1100, on. Central France in 1100, off (still feudal)...Even a twin study: West Germany, on; East Germany, off. 

**In every case, the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping it**

If you suppress variations in income (stealing or taxing) the result always seems to be the same. Society as a whole ends up poorer.

**You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich**. I’m not talking about the trickle-down effect here. I’m not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he’ll hire you as a waiter at his next party. I’m saying that he’ll make you a tractor to replace your horse.

/**

### taste for makers

**\

---


# !! such a thing as good taste? 

# $$ tastes improves as you improve 

==

“A lot of them seem smart,” he said. “What I can’t tell is whether they have any kind of taste.” 

use their technical knowledge to design beautiful things.

We need good taste to make good things. Such a thing as good taste?

Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better. Football players like to win games. CEOs like to increase earnings. It’s a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at your job. 

But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job. If taste is just personal preference, then everyone’s is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that’s it. 

As in any job, as you continue to design things, you’ll get better at it. Your tastes will change...your old tastes were not merely different, but worse.

Poof goes the axiom that taste can’t be wrong.



---

# !! what is good design?

==


different fields’ ideas of beauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again.

GOOD DESIGN IS...

1. **Simple**

It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. **You’d think simple would be the default. Ornate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative.**

Underneath the long words or the “expressive” brush strokes, there’s not much going on, and that’s frightening. 

**When you’re forced to be simple, you’re forced to face the real problem. When you can’t deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.**


2. **solves the right problem**

e.g. How do you arrange stove dials? The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row, the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time about which dial matches which burner. Better to arrange the dials in a square like the burners.

3. **suggestive**

a painting that suggests is usually more engaging than one that tells. Everyone makes up their own story

In architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it as you want

4. **Often slightly funny**

I think it’s because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one’s sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one’s sense of humor is to be wounded by them.

5. **Hard**

If you look at the people who’ve done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they worked very hard.

There is good pain and bad pain. You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the kind you get from stepping on a nail.

form should follow function. And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error. 

**Wild animals are beautiful because they have hard lives.**

6. **Easy**

Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion.

In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with practice. Perhaps what **practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought**. In some cases you literally train your body. 

e.g. An expert pianist can play notes faster than the brain can send signals to his hand. 

**When people talk about being in “the zone,” I think what they mean is that the spinal cord has the situation under control.** Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and it frees conscious thought for the hard problems.

7. **Symmetry** 

There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion. Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the pattern of veins in a leaf

8. **Nature**

It’s not so much that resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature has had a long time to work on the problem. 

9. **Redesign**

It’s rare to get things right the first time.

takes confidence to throw work away. You have to be able to think, there’s more where that came from

Mistakes are natural. Instead of treating them as disasters, **make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix**. 

*Leonardo more or less invented the sketch*, as a way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration. Open source software has fewer bugs because it admits the possibility of bugs.

10. **Copy**

Attitudes to copying often make a round trip. A novice imitates without knowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it’s more important to be right than original.

The ambitious are not content to imitate. The second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality. I think the greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness. **They just want to get the right answer, and if part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, that’s no reason not to use it. They’re confident enough to take from anyone without feeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.**

11. **often strange**

Some of the very best work has an uncanny quality:

Most of the qualities I’ve mentioned are things that can be cultivated, but I don’t think it works to cultivate strangeness. The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear. Einstein didn’t try to make relativity strange. **He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.**

But if you just try to make good things, you’ll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person walks in a distinctive way.

**The only style worth having is the one you can’t help**

12. **happens in chunks**

**Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems.** Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born near Milan instead of Florence.

At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it’s nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you’re too far removed from one of these centers.


13. **Daring**

At every period of history, people have believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.

**Today’s experimental error is tomorrow’s new theory.** If you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and truth don’t quite meet, you should pay particular attention to them.

easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty. **Most of the people who’ve made beautiful things seem to have done it by fixing something they thought ugly**

---


/** 

**You have to understand a field well before you develop a good nose for what needs fixing.** As you become expert in a field, you’ll start to hear little voices saying, What a hack! There must be a better way. Don’t ignore those voices. Cultivate them. 

**The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.**
