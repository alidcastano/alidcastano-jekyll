thoughts: One of the few diet books that doesn't just spoon feed you a short-term strategy. Lyle walks you through every step of his reasoning, and helps you set up a long term diet, tailored to your needs.

### dieting overview

---

# !! eat less, exercise more; repeat forever

==

The bottom (and rather simple) line is that you have to adjust your food intake (or activity levels) so that you’re burning more calories than you take in. (distinction between weight and fat loss)

---

# !! do fad diets work? 

# $$ they work, in short term 

==

**Even the books that tell you that you don’t have to count calories still ultimately trick you into eating less**, by adjusting what you can eat (and sometimes when you can eat it)....no way to escape that, no matter what magic they promise. 

The Problem: Most people who lose weight (through any method) will gain it all back within some period of time (months to a few years). Sometimes end up even fatter.

(Point 1: Diets work) Say "Diets don’t make you lose weight" --- completely inaccurate...Any diet that alters your energy intake (food) to expenditure (activity) will cause you to lose weight. 

(Point 2: in the short term) **simply that most people don’t maintain that weight loss in the long run.**
(poor strategy that makes it short term)

---

# !! best diet for losing weight? 

# $$ depends on: genetics, gender, activity levels, food preferences etc. 

== 

no absolute best, "it depends" on the person

activity levels, food preferences, gender, genetics all seem to affect which diet is ‘best’ (along with some generalities that all diets must meet) 

best summary of an optimal diet for the treatment of obesity: contain plenty of lean protein, lots of high fiber vegetables and fruits, moderate amounts of refined starches and moderate amounts of fat. 

>Yippee, 30 years and millions of dollars of research to conclude what my grandmother knew all along.

### fat loss vs weight loss

**\

--- 

# !! total body mass 

# $$ fat mass + lean body mass 

== 

Every tissue in your body (including muscle, bodyfat, your heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, bones, water, minerals etc.) weighs a given amount. We could (conceivably anyhow) take each of them out of your body, plop them on a scale and find out how much they weigh. Your total bodyweight is comprised of the weight of every one of those tissues. 

divide the body into two (or more) components:

1. fat mass (the sum total of the body fat you have on your body)
2. lean body mass (everything else)


LBM is lean body mass, the amount of your body that is not fat. (muscle, organs, bones, water, etc.)


---

# !! healthy body fat ranges 

==

Body fat percentage = The total amount of fat / total bodyweight 

‘authorities’ recommend as optimal ranges: 11-18% for males, 18-25% for females. 

(being too lean can also have its own set of health problems)

---

# !! weight loss vs fat loss 

==

The scale can’t tell you what you’ve lost, it can only tell you how much you have lost. 

When you’re worrying about long-term changes, the real goal is fat loss. 

e.g. WATER. cycling water weight on and off of your body (as frequently happens with certain dieting approaches) isn’t really moving you towards any real goal even if makes you think you are (may be beneficial in the short-term but it doesn’t represent true fat loss)

/**

## why diets fail 

biology versus psychology 

### biological reasons 

<small> 
(note: biology affects psychology and psychology affects biology) 
</small>

**\

---

# !! bodyweight regulation (homeostasis) 

== 

When a system is regulated, that means that it attempts (through whatever means) to maintain itself around some predetermined level.

Ex.Thermostat (Or ex. cruise control)

In both systems, the change in output (temperature or speed) changes the input, which is how the system stays regulated

**Giant loop**: as temperature drops, the thermostat senses it, the heat comes on, which increases the temperature, which the thermostat senses, turning the heat off.

Most systems in body regulated, ex. body temperature, blood pressure, glucose levels, water balance etc.

---

# !! setpoint and metabolism 

== 

body is more or less trying to maintain a given level of bodyfat, that level being called the ‘setpoint’. (or "setting point, depending on circumstance)

metabolism would slow more than you’d predict (for the weight loss) when you dieted people. To a smaller degree, metabolism would also go up when you overfed them. (As well, appetite and activity would change accordingly) 

body appears to ‘defend’ (another way of saying ‘regulate’) bodyweight against change to some degree or another. 

'defend’= adjusts its physiology (metabolic rate, appetite and a whole host of other systems up or down) to try and maintain that set/settling point 

---

# !! how does body regulate body weight? 

== 

The physiology of bodyweight regulation

start diet (increasing activity or decreasing food intake) 
--> body senses this and should decrease metabolic rate 
--> increase appetite, decrease activity levels and make fat mobilization and loss more difficult 

metabolism is depressed 

**progressively more difficult to lose weight and easier to regain the lost weight once it was lost**

(part of the reason that exercise greater effect at helping to maintain weight loss than fat loss on a diet: exercise helps to offset some of the negative adaptations that occur after weight loss)

also: **the system is asymmetrical and most people find it far far easier to gain weight than to lose it**

being that getting fat was never a problem during our evolutionary past, while starving to death was a very real possibility.

genetic minority: same people whose bodies resist weight gain the most tend to lose weight the most easily and vice versa: people who find weight loss the most difficult find weight gain relatively easier

### How does it work?

e.g. thermostat: source of input (the temperature), a measurement device (the thermostat/thermometer), and a source of output (signals to the heater or air conditioner)... And, of course, the output then affects the input, forming a loop.


MEASUREMENT DEVICE. Part of the brain called the **hypothalamus**. This is where the body’s setpoint is both set and monitored based on the environment 
(mainly nutrition and food intake, and also body fat levels). 

(some evidence that becoming and staying fat can almost permanently raise the set-point)

INPUT (signals) **hormones change when food intakes or fat levels change** (include leptin, insulin, ghrelin, peptide YY, glucose)and **‘tell’ your hypothalamus** when it’s moving away from the set-point (current state of your bodyweight/bodyfat level) 

OUTPUT (actions). **metabolic** rate can be adjusted upwards or downwards due to changes in nervous system output and **levels of thyroid hormone** 

brain more or less adjusts the function of the entire body: **Appetite and hunger** can change, sometimes drastically. **Spontaneous activity** can go up or down which is part of why people tend to get lethargic when they diet. Levels of other hormones such as **testosterone**, estrogen and progesterone can be affected (part of why dieting tends to affect women’s menstrual cycle and why men who get extremely lean can have problems with libido or sexual function) 


---

/** 
 
### psychological reasons

**\

---


# !! genetics vs. environment

# $$  third world country versus modern western environment 

==

biology is never the only determinant of any factor of our behavior (only genetic certainty is death, although some researchers think we can even fix that) 

At most, genetics contribute perhaps 50% to any behavior or aspect of our biology. **The other 50% is environment**.

Ex. someone with high weight/fat ‘setpoint’ in a third world country (daily hard labor and there is little food available), they would not get fat; the environment wouldn’t allow it

**modern Western environment = recipe for weight gain** (easy access to inexpensive, tasty, high calorie food and low daily activity requirements)

--- 

# !! resist tendencies 

**Human biology works through tendencies** and people show varying abilities to resist or act against those tendencies

Successful dieter = **lose weight and keep it off regardless of the biology that is trying to pull you back** 

They do it by changing their behavior fairly permanently.


---

/**

## who fails? 

Diet versus dieter 

**\ 

---

/**

### how dieters fail

**\

---

# !! too absolute/perfectionism

==

The problem is that any slip, no matter how small, is taken as complete and utter failure. The diet is abandoned and the post-diet food binge begins. 

e.g. cookie -- weakness or distraction, the guilt sets in — eat whole bag

rigid dieters, see the world in a rather extreme right or wrong approach: either 100% perfection on diet or they're off their diet, shoveling crap in
(same mentality with exercise)

extremes can become source of failure --- drives you towards better and better results, such an attitude will work, until you finally slip (matter of when)

80/20 principle 

--- 

# !! focusing only on short term

== 

about the best you can usually do with true fat loss (not water weight or muscle loss) is somewhere between 1.5-3 lbs./week (fatter individuals can sometimes lose more)...and, rare to see perfectly linear fat loss without stalls or plateaus.

dieters think once they lose weight, they can revert to their old habits and still keep the weight off...

go back to habits that made you fat in the first place, you’ll get fat again…

**small changes seem easier to maintain in the long-term**, even if they don’t generate results as rapidly. 

**trade-off**: painfully slow weight loss and long term results OR extreme approaches that generate rapid results but are nearly impossible to stick to in the long-term. 

(compromise could be extreme diet and then moderate approach) 

painful reality: stop thinking of diets as a short-term behavior change
(though it is easier to maintain weight than to lose it)

--- 

/** 

### how diets fail dieter

**\

---

# !! too much hunger

==

biggest causes of diet failure is plain old hunger

(no coincidence that the majority of diet pills are appetite suppressants.... but such stimulants have side effects and can’t be used in the long-term)

good long-term diet should do at least some job of controlling appetite. Many diets fail in this regards. 

**Problem = human appetite and hunger is simply too complex for a single diet to control them in every situation** --- interaction of both physiological and psychological components determines the end results

PHYSIOLOGICAL. **human appetite is regulated by complex biological systems** --- the physical stretching of the stomach, the levels of different nutrients in the blood, brain chemistry, and even changes in fat cell size.

PSYCHOLOGYICAL. **Humans are also one of the few animals who eat for purely non-hunger related reasons** --- boredom, depression, because it’s meal time, because we saw a TV commercial, because we are out with friends, etc.

and, physiology and psychology interact! Not just psychological weakness. Changes in brain chemistry, under the influence of signals from other parts of your body, are sending powerful ‘eat now!’ signals to you as you starve your body into submission)

perfectionism and deprivation make this worse 

also,  trigger foods --- food addictions regarding certain foods (or categories of food) --- which may demand complete avoidance (or very controlled intake) is the only solution (or a happy compromises)

---

# !! not matched to dieter

==

general principles but variance into what people respond too

not as simple as saying ‘Do this and ye shall succeed’ or a lot more people would be succeeding. Some individualization is always needed. .. (however, people want THE ANSWER and fall for marketing gimmicks)

Diet tricks (e.g. low fat or low carb) tend to cause people to eat less, at least initially. Then they invariably start eating more of the foods that they are allowed and weight loss stops or reverses.


---

/** 
### flexible dieting

**\

---


# !! dieting guidelines

== 

- The first is that it has to cause an imbalance between your energy expenditure (via daily activity and exercise) and your energy intake (from food).
- adequate protein (at least 25% of total calories), as it is most appetite blunting nutrient; and tend to cause slightly more fat loss and slightly less LBM loss. 
- plenty of roughage, vegetables and some fruits, which goes a long way in keeping you full.
- some provision for essential fatty acids should be made. 
- moderate fat intakes show better adherence (low-fat diets tend to taste like cardboard)

Frankly, beyond those few requirements, I feel that the rest of the diet has more to do with what’s appropriate for the individual than anything else. 

e.g. more high intensity exercise, demands more carbohydrates 
e.g. insulin resistant do better with reduced carbohydrates


people who feel great on carb based diets tend to do poorly and feel horrible on low-carbohydrate diets, they feel lethargic and listless
VS. 
people who find that their energy levels crash badly on carbohydrate based diets tend to do well and feel great when they reduce carbohydrates and increase protein, fat and fiber


---

/** 

## diet breaks 

**\

--- 

# !! controlled diet breaks  

== 

“Wing RR and RW Jeffrey. Prescribed ‘Breaks’ as a means to disrupt weight control efforts

subjects were told by the researchers to go off their diet; in essence, the break was part of the diet. And they didn’t blow up, didn’t gain a ton of weight, and had no problem going right back onto the diet.

key difference (and why study failed: control.)

e.g. rigid dieter hammering away on your perfect diet, no lapses, no mistakes. Suddenly something comes up that is out of your control. A stressful period of life, the aforementioned vacation, whatever. Feeling out of control, you figure your diet is blown and the binge begins. Does this sound familiar at all?

Psychologically, feeling like the break is now under your control, or that it’s part of your overall plan, makes it far easier to not feel like the diet is completely blown and get back on the diet when things settle down

(expecting 100% adherence, on the other hand, is generally a recipe for disaster)

In situations you can't control, just do your best; damage control 



Warning 1: starting a new diet, be relatively strict with it for the first few weeks (get into the swing of the new eating habits --- e.g. **taste buds take time to adjust** --- before you take breaks)

warning: do not be surprised if your bodyweight spikes a little bit (increased storage of carbohydrate in muscles and liver, as every gram of carbohydrate stored stores an addition 3 grams of water and this can add up to a rather considerable amount) 



---

# !! free Meals

== 

cheat meal or reward meal…

main benefit = psychological; a single meal isn’t really long enough to affect physiological responses to dieting

free meal lets you address any cravings; eat forbidden’ foods (never suffer from the psychologically induced deprivation that you can’t EVER have a certain food)

Note: A free meal is NOT a deliberate attempt to see how much food you can stuff down your gullet in a single meal 

**People fall out of one psychological trap (that breaking the diet at all is a huge failure on their part) and into another (they try to see how much crap they can gorge themselves on during their breaks)**


*Guidelines*

- eat out of the house, at a restaurant. (less likely to go nuts)
- make free meal a dinner meal (wake up in the morning, normal dieting rhythm)
-  put the free meal on a day when you exercised.
-  keep some diet parameters, just have some of the forbidden stuff too 
- space out your free meals on nonconsecutive days


---

# !! structured refeeds 

==


periods of high- carbohydrate overfeeding --- may last anywhere from 5 hours (at the shortest) to one day (12-24 hours, probably the average) to three days

has additional physiological benefits that the free meal lacks

not simply to overeat carbohydrates for the sake of overeating carbohydrates 
(psychological benefit) ..specific physiological reasons: normalizing the hormones which are regulating bodyweight, refilling muscle glycogen, etc.

high-carbohydrate and ideally fairly low in fat

structured reefed would take the place of a free meal (you do not get to add them together)


**Physiological benefits**

- refilling of muscle glycogen (sustain exercise performance)
- temporarily turn off diet induced catabolism (roughly: tissue breakdown), helping to spare LBM/muscle loss. (more important as people get leaner)
- and longer diet break may help to normalize most, if not all, of the hormones (overeating the other nutrients -- fats and proteins -- doesn’t have the same effects on all of these hormones)


Warning: “Overeat carbohydrates for 12-24 hours” does not mean “Eat nothing but junk food for 12-24 hours straight.”


same guidelines as free meal, along with: 

- keep fat below 50 grams of fat (suggest that you track/measure)
    - combination of a lot of carbohydrates and fat is a wonderful way to regain bodyfat 


**Types of carbs**

- centered around dietary starches (e.g. breads, bagels, potatoes, etc)
- Some junk food is ok (and probably desirable) but too much sucrose (table sugar) or fructose (fruit sugar) tends to cause problems
    - 100 grams of sucrose (easy to go over with lots of candy) and 50 grams of fructose (which is a probably 5-7 normal pieces of fruit -- real problem in this area is high fructose corn syrup)


TA: all starches, moderate amounts of fruit (2-3 pieces total), and some junk food (think nonfat ice cream or sherbet, Snackwell’s types of cookies)

(individuals suffering from some degree of insulin resistance -- adequate protein, fiber and a small amount of dietary fat with each high-carbohydrate meal goes a long way)


**Duration**


5 hours, 1 day (breakfast to dinner), 2 days (morning to evening for 2 consecutive days)

total carbohydrate intake should be spread across the entire time frame, with a meal occurring every 2-3 hours or so (important to keep blood glucose and insulin up/stable which both avoids problems with energy crashes and helps to upregulate all of the hormonal systems that we are addressing)

ideal to synchronize an exercise sessions with the refeed

Tip 1: only buy what they intend to eat (avoids overconsumption)

Tip 2: schedule on non work day (not dealing with blood sugar swings)

**Frequency**

main factors: 

- how hard you’re dieting 
- starting bodyfat percentage
- activity patterns 


For someone not genetically disposed to it, trying to get below 10% bodyfat is essentially no different than starving to death (from the body’s perspective): keeping things moving means refeeding more frequently.

As a general rule, as with amounts: start conservative and increase amounts based on results

a) if you find yourself getting fuller (muscularly) and leaner after your refeeds, you can try increasing the amounts
b) if you find yourself waking up flat and puffy, you either ate too many total carbohydrates or ate too much sucrose or fructose --- need to alter either the quality or quantity of your refeed

only difference between exercise category 1 and 2 dieters is that category 2 dieters should always start with the lower amount of carbohydrate recommendations; since they aren’t as glycogen depleted going into the refeed, excess carbohydrates tend to have more problems ‘spilling over’ into fat cells

exercise category 1 can ‘get away’ with the most during their structured refeeds (includes amount of carbs that they can consume as well as the types)

**amounts**

note: refeed numbers are conservative because cannot ensure glycogen depletion 

- 4-6 grams/lb was appropriate for the first 24 hours
- (if second day) perhaps half of that or an additional 2-3 grams/lb 

**calorie partitioning**


The reason that you don’t just get fat again is that, in the short-term, incoming carbohydrates go to muscle and liver glycogen first; energy production second; and fat storage last.

under conditions of glycogen depletion, the body can handle this type of calorie overload in the short-term without getting fat 

---

# !! alternative: listen to your body

# $$ appetite vs. hunger (proxy for NPY levels)

==

In scientific terms hunger refers to a short-term desire for food. So you get hungry, you eat a meal, you get full, you stop eating. Appetite describes a longer term drive for food. Clearly, they overlap. =

**key molecules = NPY, or neuropeptide Y** When NPY levels go up in the brain, the body’s entire attention seems to be drawn to food

dieters (especially as they get leaner) tend to reach a point where they move beyond just being hungry. They find that they are basically obsessed with food. 

being in good touch with their bodies is key; can almost feel the various biological systems (metabolic rate, etc.) shutting down. (Energy drops, they feel lethargic, sex drives goes down, etc)

ability to differentiate basic diet induced hunger from the type of all consuming obsession with food that occurs when NPY levels really skyrocket

when NPY levels are off, good sign refeed should be performed

---


# !! full diet break

== 


psychological: by breaking your dieting efforts up into smaller chunks, while maintaining control over your eating in the long-term, you are less likely to lose control or go off of your diet completely

physiological: Even with the proper use of free meals and structured refeeds, eventually the body adapts to a point where the diet that was once generating decent fat loss is no longer doing so

By raising calories, we raise leptin (and normalize the other hormones) and metabolism tends to recover, helping the next phase of dieting work more effectively. 

goal is to try to fix metabolism without gaining back so much weight or fat that you end up worse off (worth it to gain a few pounds if that means you lose fat at a faster rate when returning to your diet)

**reset adaptive component**: One of the primary goals of the full diet break is to reset all of those hormones (to one degree or another) to try to correct the adaptive reduction in metabolic rate (drop in caloric expenditure)


must have sufficient carbs: crucial for the upregulation of thyroid hormone;  along with raising leptin and insulin (and thus nervous system output) 

1.  dietary carbohydrate intake needs to be at least 100 grams per day. 
2. calories need to be raised to maintenance levels


---

/**

## maintenance diet

**\

---- 

# !! maintain narrow range 

==

maintain your bodyweight or bodyfat within a relatively narrow range, maybe 3-5 pounds either direction (some fluctuations expected)

weigh yourself regularly -- see if you are slipping and regaining the lost weight/fat so that they can buckle down again

spend a week counting calories --- b/c most people are simply atrocious at estimating their food intake.

---- 


# !! slow versus fast approach

==

Two approaches: Fast (calories are basically ramped up to maintenance. can be done in concert with a structured refeed) versus Slow (calories are gradually raised to maintenance)

big advantage of the slow approach is that it avoid major weight spikes which can cause negative psychological effects. The disadvantage is that it’s less fun and more meticulous 

at most you should take the first week (of two) to reach maintenance and spend at least 7 days at maintenance levels

---

/**

### non counting method

**\

---

# !! how nutrients influence behavior

== 

**The effects of nutrients on spontaneous food intake**

- high fat diets tend to promote passive overconsumption (eat more at a given meal without noticing it). Problem because in the short-term (over a meal), fat doesn’t blunt hunger or alter food intake

- low carb benefit: remove an entire category of food (carbohydrates) that happens to make up 50% or more of people’s food intakes, they pretty much can’t help but eat less. (and protein goes up, which blunts hunger)


**how nutrients affect satiety and satiation**

Satiety is basically short-term hunger, appetite (or satiation) is long term hunger 

- fat negligible effect in short term (passive overconsumption); protein and carbs blunt hunger better in short term
- extremely low-fat intakes, especially when they are coupled with low-fiber, low-protein and refined carbohydrates make people hungrier (carbs hitting the bloodstream very rapidly, first spiking and then crashing blood glucose which tends to promote hunger)


**dietary fat is sort of a double edged sword when it comes to caloric intake, satiety and satiation**

- High dietary fat intakes tend to promote excessive caloric intakes via the passive overconsumption effects
- very low fat intakes tend to leave people hungrier sooner (especially when combined with highly refined carbohydrates and too little protein and fiber) and they end up eating more as well


**argues for a moderate fat intake** (20-25% of total calorie --- better dietary adherence and improve health more)


**protein has been found to have the greatest impact on hunger;carbs come in second and fat is last**

whether carbs or fat depends:

- Unrefined naturally occurring carbohydrates tend to keep people fairly full, especially when combined with protein, fat and fiber
- the more highly refined carbohydrates (i.e. the ones people are actually eating in the real world) seem to stimulate hunger more often than not



---

# !! non counting recommendations 

1. Eat more frequently

- keeps hunger better under control (avoid extreme hunger when meals are spaced out too far, i.e., decreasing blood glucose)
- eating smaller meals overall has an effect on the stomach’s stretchability; decreasing it over time. (large meals stretch stomach more). And stomach that is less easily stretched tends to fill up faster

(note: not about adding snacks but splitting caloric intake)


2. Eat plenty of lean protein

- greatest effect on blunting hunger
- limit weight gain, and channel weight gain towards LBM

Somewhere between 3-6 ounces (fit in your cupped palm, about the same size as a deck of cards) 

(also, higher calcium intakes, especially from dairy sources, has benefits in terms of bodyfat and bodyweight levels)

3. Eat a moderate amount of fat at each meal

trans-fatty acids have no place in any healthy diet; saturated fats, found primarily in animal products, hard to avoid but should be limited; monounsaturated fats (e.g. olive oil) should make up the majority of your fat intake; polyunsaturates, that is essential fatty acids(W-6 fatty acids are found readily in our food supply while w-3 are not) should be suffice 

easy to over consume dietary fat (calorically dense) so recommended to measure out intake 

10-14 grams per meal 

As a general rule: if your other food choices (such as low-fat dairy) contain dietary fat, dont add more to meal (odds are it's already enough). If your other foods contain little to no fat (nonfat dairy), you should add a small amount of dietary fat to the meal

4. Eat plenty of fiber from vegetables, fruits, unrefined carbs (e.g. beans)

benefits of fiber go far beyond health, it is a potent aid to both weight loss and maintenance eating. 

(trifecta effect on fullness)
- keep food in the stomach longer, promoting fullness
- takes up quite a bit of room in the stomach and the physical stretching of the stomach is one (of many) signals for fullness
- fiber is chewy and takes time to eat, meals high in fiber tend to automatically slow down your eating, giving your brain time to register that you’re full

Added benefit: foods high in fiber are also high in nutrients, both vitamins and minerals that are required for health, as well as a class of nutrients called phytonutrients which are turning out to have numerous health benefits.


5. Eat moderate amounts of refined carbohydrates (e.g bread and pasta)

Many people can readily over consume such foods..And they can be somewhat energy dense (be more problematic than fruits, vegetables and the naturally occurring carbohydrates)

also suggest you spend a bit of time getting familiar with serving sizes

rule of thumb:  limit your starchy carbohydrates at any given meal to the amount that would fit in a cupped palm (just like protein above) or slightly more. 

6. Eat slowly

satiety/fullness standpoint, eating more slowly is beneficial. The reason is that there is a delay between eating and when your brain gets the ‘signal’ (which is sent via nerves and chemicals in your bloodstream) that you are full.

7. Continue to utilize free meals and/or structured refeeds

though recommendations are free form, there are still restrictions in terms of what you can and can’t eat (i.e. you can’t eat anything you want in unlimited amounts). Allowing for a free meal or two each week will go a long way psychologically to sticking with the other dietary habits you’re trying to maintain. 

8. Exercise

primary role of exercise is in maintaining weight loss/preventing weight regain; and psychologically, many people seem to link their eating and exercise habits: they tend to be more aware of their eating and strive to eat healthier when they are exercising 

---

/**

### calculating method

**\

---


# !! determine maintenance calorie levels

== 

by definition, your maintenance calorie level represents the number of calories per day that you need to maintain your current weight within some range

Total energy expenditure = BMR + TEA + TEF + NEAT

(most variable parts of the above equation are TEA and NEAT which can both vary quite significantly between individuals. BMR and TEF tend to be fairly consistent.)

1. average, a multiplier of 12-16 calories per pound of total bodyweight is about right (with highly trained athletes going higher) to estimate maintenance 

2. Because dieting slows the metabolism somewhat, we’re going to adjust that down by about 10% to account for metabolic slowdown giving a range of 11-15 calories per pound or so.

bodyweight x multiplier = total calories/day 



---

# !! set macronutrient intakes

== 

**Set protein intake**

protein intake is the single most important aspect of any diet.

1 g/lb is more than sufficient 


**Set carbohydrate intake**

base line level of 100 g/day to avoid ketosis (not bad or dangerous but we don’t know extended long-term effect)

may end up at a higher carbohydrate intake because of other factors, but you won’t ever go lower

**Set fat intake**

fat intake is simply used as a caloric buffer to make up the rest of your daily calories


----


# !! counting tips

== 

Most people tend to eat more or less the same day in day out, take the time to sit down and come up with what are essentially modular meals

- first, pick their protein source(because some protein sources contain some fat)
- next, ensure your vegetable intake. (no need to count except for starchy vegetables, e.g., carrots, peas, and corn) 
- next, fruit 
- next, add a starch if you have any carbs left and want to
- lastly, fill remaining with dietary fat (focus on monounsaturated fats, as you’ll get sufficient saturated fats unless you avoid all nonfat meats and dairy) 

(if you have to eat out a lot, figuring out what places allow you to meet your nutritional requirements most easily)

---

/**

## diet adjustments 

**\

---

# !! expected fat loss

==

**1-2 pound week true fat loss is about all that can realistically be expected** with a more moderate or traditional type of calorically restricted diet. Though extremely large or fatter individuals can often lose somewhat more (maybe 3-4 pounds) (diets claiming more its mostly water not true fat loss)

---

# !! macro reductions

as always, protein intake stays the same, with the adjustment coming to carbohydrate and fat intake. 

in general, I’d say cut back your carbohydrate (starches and grains, fruits if you have to) intake a bit; cutting back fat slightly is another option although very low fat diets tend to backfire


---


# !! 10% changes every 2 weeks

==

**10% calorie changes. Then maintain that for 2-3 weeks and remeasure.**

- if you’re losing less than one pound per week on average (and you’re not an extremely light female) you need to cut calories further
- anybody who is losing a consistent 1-1.5 pounds per week is basically in the sweet spot (though if category 2/3 can decrease further to see if they can achieve a slightly higher weekly fat loss)
- fat loss of greater than 2 pounds per week depends on the circumstances.
    -  A category 2 or 3 dieter may have no problem losing that much weight weekly and probably shouldn’t adjust calories. The real issue is for category 1 dieters, as a loss that great might signal muscle/LBM loss. Should use their performance or strength as the deciding factor.
        -  Losing 2 lbs./week and NOT losing strength or seeing a decrement in performance, they are probably ok (otherwise increase calories)

(also possible to increase activity via exercise)

note: rare for fat loss to occur in a linear or nonstop fashion (hence, 2-3 week adjustments)
