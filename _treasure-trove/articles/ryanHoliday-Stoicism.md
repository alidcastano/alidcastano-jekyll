# !! what is Stoicism?

# $$ virtue is sufficient for happiness

== 

Definition: *"The endurance of pain or hardship without a display of feelings and without complaint"*

Stoicism is a a philosophy built for action; **a meditative technique that transforms negative emotions into a sense of calm and perspective**; a tool that we can use to become better entrepreneurs, better friends, and better people

The Stoics were writing honestly, often self-critically, about how they could become better people, be happier, and deal with the problems they faced.

Three principle leaders: *Marcus Aurelius* (emperor of the Roman Empire, the most powerful man on earth, sat down each day to write himself notes about restraint, compassion and humility), *Epictetus* (endured the horrors of slavery to found his own School where he taught many of Rome’s greatest minds), and *Seneca* (when Nero turned on him and demanded his suicide, could think only of comforting his wife and friends).

# !! practice what you fear, i.e., misfortune 

# $$ comfort is worst kind of slavery -- always be ready for adversity 

== 

> Show me a man who isn’t a slave; one who is a slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition; all are slaves to hope or fear....**And there is no state of slavery more disgraceful than one which is self-imposed**.
<cite> Seneca </cite>

*Comfort is the worst kind of slavery* because you’re always afraid that something or someone will take it away. 

If you practice misfortune then chance loses its ability to disrupt your life

*live* misfortune (not just think about it)

Ex. Montaigne - ancient drinking game where the members took turns holding up a painting of a corpse inside a coffin and cheered “Drink and be merry for when you’re dead you will look like this.”

**Emotions like anxiety and fear have their roots in uncertainty and rarely in experience.** The solution = do something about that ignorance. Familiarize yourself with the the worst-case scenarios that you’re afraid of.

Practice what you fear, whether a simulation in your mind or in real-life.

It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times (strengthened against nature's rebuffs)

# !! train perception to avoid the good and bad  

# $$ flip the obstacle upside down -- turn problems into opportunity 

== 

> The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. <cite> Marcus Aurelius </cite>

If you can properly turn a problem upside down, every “bad” becomes a new source of good.

Ex. someone unwilling to cooperate = directing you towards new virtues, i.e, patience/understanding 

**To the Stoic, everything is opportunity.**

# !! keep ego manageable and in perspective 

# $$ don't dwell on pain or cling to ephemeral happiness 

==

> Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both. <cite> Marcus Aurelius </cite>

Remember that achievements can be ephemeral, and that your possession of them is for just an instant. 

Ex. Learn from Alexander’s mistake: got into fight with friend and accidentally killed him. 

Marcus Aurelius simple remedy: “Run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend… or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.”

Be humble and honest and aware. Unlike transient accomplishments, that is something you can have every single day of your life.

*Not dwelling on pain and not clinging to ephemeral happiness*. Enjoy it to the fullest, but don’t expect it to last forever, nor expect some single point in time to make your entire life complete forever.

**We’re all addicts in some respect, and we can all experience the same freedom.**
