    Sivers compresses knowledge from the 200+ books he's read into succinct and actionable advice, or directives.

    I've personally been thinking a lot about "How to be useful," specifically the idea of sharing everything that you can in public. Siver's definitely exemplifies this in his blog, and it's an idea I also want to model in mine.

# !! How to be useful? And what to do once you're successful? 

==

How to be useful: 

1. Get famous (do everything in public and reach more people)
2. Get rich (neutral proof of value, side effect of being useful)
3. Share strong opinions (triggers action)
4. Be expensive (a form placebo)

Then, when you're successful: 

1. Change yes to "Hell yeah!" or no (or you'll drown in opportunities)
2. Keep momentum (don't take it easy)

# !! How to get rich? And how to stop being rich / what to avoid? 

== 

How to be rich: 

1. Live where luck strikes (be in middle of everything)
2. Say yes to everything (treat opportunities like like lottery tickets)
3. Learn multiplying skills (e.g. speaking, writing, programming)
4. Pursue market value not personal value (do what pays well)
5. Shamelessly imitate success (it leaves clues)
6. Be the owner, not just the inventor (execution makes you rich)
7. Benefit from human nature (learn the game and play it)

And what not to do:

1. Prioritize lifestyle design (or immediate gratification over contribution)
2. Chase that comparison
3. Buy, not rent (tie your identity to belongings)
4. Internalize new status 
5. Be a connoisseur (insist on only the finest)
6. Get to know your processions (become attached)
7. Acclimate to comfort

# !! How to thrive in unknowable future

==

1. Prepare for the worst 
2. Expect disaster (and appreciate things more)
3. Own as little as possible
4. Choose opportunity, not loyalty (do what is best for future of your current situation, loyalty only to most important relationships)
5. Choose plan with most options (similar to 
Paul Graham's [Stay Upwind](/StayUpwind))
6. Avoid planning (max options = no plans)
