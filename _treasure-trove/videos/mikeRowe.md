# !! Don't follow your passion. Chase opportunity. 

== 

**Most successful people saw where everyone was going and just went opposite direction**

1. Do what no one else is doing 
2. Be very good at it 
3. Learn to love something you didn't think you did

(Career malaise is because of following wrong advice)

Just because you love something doesn't mean you can suck at it. i.e. American idol episode 1. You see collision between reality and dreams, that kids are realizing for the first time. **It's personal as a viewer because you can't watch that and not look at your own soft spots; we are covered with them. We're all just rotten fruit.**

(To be incrementally better is not enough, you have to be different )

**Never follow your passion, but always bring it with you**


[1:17] elegant and indulgent about finding different way to say a thing --- important to be simple and brief, other way is indulgent -- lexicon is extraordinary

# !! find the the peripeteia of a person's life

== 

Find big transformational moment --- the peripeteia --- in everybody's life and find a way to unwind it, clue after clue. 

(The peripeteia is part of narrative where we realize our identity is at odds with something we just learned or the way rest of world sees us --- or cognitive dissonance, or inflection points in a persons life) 

Story of Peter Hernandez who did not want to give up his heritage but also did not want to be narrowed as a Latino performer because of his name. Eventually changed his first name to fathers favorite wrestler and last name to his favorite planet, and became Bruno Mars. 


**Find a way to take a thing people are disinterested about and make them care.** (If you can make oranges interesting, you win.)

Makes challenge much more attackable if you think about how to differentiate yourself. 

**Real geniuses inspire curiosity; it's not just imparting knowledge, it's about flicking the switch**

(From Tim: make the content the way you like it, i.e., long form, serves as weeding out process for type of fans you want)
