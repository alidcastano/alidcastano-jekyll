thoughts: |
    Fascinating seeing Richard Feynman talk about science, teaching, and work, with such simplicity and cadence that he makes the entire video thoroughly enjoyable to watch. 

quote: |
    Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it. <br>
    - Richard Feyman

# !! [28:24] out of complexity, simplicity appears 

==

"When you discover new things, appears on the whole to be more complicated because we learn about a greater experience... [Then] every once in a while we have these *integrations in which everything's pulled together into a unification*, in which it turns out to be simpler than it looked before."

# !! [38:20] concept of active irresponsibility

== 

putting ideas together as shaky as building deck of cards, explains concept of active irresponsibility to minimize/eliminate interruptions

*"Let George do it" - "I want to do my physics"*

(similar to Cal Newport's belief in the necessity of 
[deep work](/books/DeepWork) and 
Derek Siver's philosophy for time management 
["Hell yeah!" or no](/books/AnythingYouWant).)

# !! [:40:00] have no philosophy for teaching; try everything

==

philosophy for teaching: have no philosophy; be chaotic--use every possible way of doing it 

example of teaching his son versus his daughter (different hooks to catch different kinds of minds/interests)

(The above documentary led me to an all out Richard Feyman youtube binge, in which I found another great video series of him where he talks about physics to explain how the world works.)

I'll be referring back to the snippets below whenever I need inspiration on how to effectively explain a difficult concept (he definitely lives up to his philosophy for teaching described above, of being chaotic and trying every possible way to get the point across).

- [0:40]  Jiggling Atoms
- [11:50] Rubber Bands
- [14:34] Magnets (and ice addendum)
- [22:07] Electric Force
- [32:27] Mirrors
- [34:56] Train-Tracks
- [37:23] Seeing Things
- [47:49] Stars, Pulsars and Black Holes

# !! [14:34] perpetually asking why

# $$ framework / common ground and edge cases

==

The problem with why, example: Aunt Minnie is in the hospital. Why? Went out on ice and broke her hip. That explanation might satisfy a normal person, but wouldn't satisfy someone who came from another planet. 

(Why do you go to hospital when your hip is broken? How do you get to the hospital? How did she slip on ice--why is ice slippery? Why did she fall down when she slipped? etc.) Same problem when you're explaining technical concepts.

You have to be in some framework that allows something to be true. Otherwise you're perpetually asking why. 

Have to know what your permitted to understand and what the common ground is with the person whom your explaining a concept to...

many different levels of understanding, which depends on whether you are a student of the subject
