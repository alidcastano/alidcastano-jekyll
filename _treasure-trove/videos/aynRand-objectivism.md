thoughts: |
    Ayn rand's provocative novels and contrarian philosophy are said to be 
    over-idealistic, to champion an unrealistic extreme. But in an artificial world, the way I see it, only extremist live naturally. And in my opinion, her convictions lie in an extreme most people can benefit from; they'd likely find themselves in a happy middle, living more for themselves, with a higher sense of reason and purpose&mdash;rather than as completely selfish and impalpable human beings, as is often criticized. That's at least where I want to find myself, hence my appeal to Rand's novels and subsequent interest in the intricacies of her philosophy, noted below.

# !! [2:08] what is Objectivism?

# $$ live by independent judgment of own mind and for your own happiness

== 

A philosophy based on objective reality. Not based on faith, arbitrary whim, or emotion. A morality based on reason, that can be proved by means of logic and can be demonstrated to be true and necessary. 

1. Reality exists as an objective absolute. (Universe is what is it, not what we wanted it to be. "Wishing won't make it so")
2. Mans mind, reason, is his means of perceiving it. (Reality is, in the quest to live we must discover reality’s nature and learn to act successfully in it)
3. Man needs a rational mortality.  (Our basic choice in life is “to think or not.”Can't accept contradictions. "You can't eat your cake and have it, too")

>Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed. - Francis Bacon 

To live on earth, hold reason as an absolute---his only guide to action---and **live by independent judgment of his own mind**. 

Man's life as a standard of value. **Highest moral purpose is achievement of his own happiness.** Each man must live "as an end in himself" and follow his own rational self interest.  

Man must choose his actions, values and goals in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimate value, that end in itself, which is his own life.

**A life of reason, purpose, and self-esteem**

/**

> My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute - Ayn Rand

# !! [4:45] altruism and sacrifice 

# $$ man is not a sacrificial animal 

== 

"I don't like is to weak a word; I consider it [altruism] evil"

Challenge moral code of altruism. The precept that mans moral duty is to live for others, that man must sacrifice himself for others. 

Self sacrifice is the precept that man must serve others to justify his existence. **Altruism makes man a sacrificial animal.**

**Man is entitled to his own happiness.** And that he must achieve it himself 
(not demand it from others). Man should have self-esteem.

Not for the sake of helping others but serving others to create value. Theres a difference.

# !! [6:38] love and standards

# $$ if you love without any standard then you are asked to love nobody 

== 

Immoral if it is a love placed above oneself. In fact, that sort of love is impossible. **If you are asked to love everybody causelessly and indiscriminately----without any standard---you are asked to love nobody.**

Isn't the essence of love above self interest? Imagine telling your partner, "I am marrying you just for your own sake, I am so unselfish that I have no personal interest; I am marrying you only for your own good." Would anyone like that? 

Love should be treated like a business deal. But every business has its own terms and its own type of currency. **With love, the currency is virtue.** You love people not for what they do for you or what you do for them, but for their values which they achieved in their own character.

What about the weak, do you not consider the fallibility of human beings.? Man has free will; if a man wants love he should correct his weaknesses or flaws, then he may deserve it. **But he can not expect the unearned.** Open to everybody and that is what my morality offers them.


>  Love is a response to values. It is with a person’s sense of life that one falls in love—with that essential sum, that fundamental stand or way of facing existence, which is the essence of a personality. One falls in love with the embodiment of the values that formed a person’s character, which are reflected in his widest goals or smallest gestures, which create the style of his soul—the individual style of a unique, unrepeatable, irreplaceable consciousness.

# !! [9:39] politics and capitalism

# $$ no right to exert force or compulsion on any citizen except a criminal
==

Collectivism or socialism, system under which everybody is enslaved to everybody.

Even if it comes about democratically? Majority prevails in political affairs but limited by unalienable, individual rights--- cannot vote away life, or property, or freedom. (Majority vote would not make issue right.)

Voluntary consent and cooperation of free man. 

Voters elect officials but powers of government strictly limited. **No right to exert force or compulsion on any citizen except a criminal** (those that initiated force, can be punished by force, but no one else.) That is the only function of government: placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control.

Opposed to all forms of control (e.g. taxes -- *the misfortune of some is a mortgage on others.*). For an absolute, laize fair---free, unregulated economy. (Separate government from economics, like the separation between state and church.)

> There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of farmers, of workers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, of the young, of the unborn.” There are only the Rights of Man—rights possessed by every individual man and by all men as individuals.

# !! [14:10] religion vs. reason 

# $$ faith is the negation of reason

==

No faith in anything, only in your mind? **"That is not faith; that is a conviction."**

God? Can't prove that there is; cant prove that there isn't. But law of logic: never called to call upon to prove a negative. 

there's no such thing as an orderly universe, our whole concept of order comes from observing reality 

people accepted because nobody can live without a philosophy

religion is primitive form of philosophy, system of background premises

religion gives you canned answers, and tells you to rely on it and you don’t need to think---give up reason

religion gives man permission to function irrationally, to accept something outside the power of their reason

use your life to best of your understanding, if you go by emotions, not reason, it means you are going against reality

Self-esteem is precondition of freedom. If we have no self-esteem any demagogue can have us; be anxious to follow anyone because you don't trust yourself 

you start with what exists as a fact and you see how much you can learn about it

"I will not die.  The world that will end"

/**

(I often hear people call Ayn Rand a hypocrite. She lived off Social Security, they say, the very system she condemned. Whether she did or not, doesn't make a difference to me---I've learned not to judge the [man in the arena](/quote-notes/ManInTheArena). Nonetheless, I wasn't sure how to explain or reconcile any form of charity with her philosophy, so below are the notes I gathered on the subject.)

# !! charity - moral duty vs. human benevolence 

# $$ reference one's rational self interest and hierarchy of values 

==

>My views on charity are very simple. I do not consider it a major virtue and, above all, I do not consider it a moral duty. There is nothing wrong in helping other people, if and when they are worthy of the help and you can afford to help them. I regard charity as a marginal issue. **What I am fighting is the idea that charity is a moral duty and a primary virtue**

Her philosophy condoned only private charity --- not through government and not through force 

**altruism that has corrupted and perverted human benevolence**

*When to accept help?* morally proper to accept help, 1) when it is offered, not as a moral duty, but as an act of good will and generosity 2) when the giver can afford it (doesn't involve self-sacrifice) 3) when it is offered in response to the receiver’s virtues, not in response to his flaws, weaknesses or moral failures, and not on the ground of his need as such.

*When to give help?* proper method of judging when or whether one should help another person is by **reference to one’s own rational self-interest and one’s own hierarchy of values**: the time, money or effort one gives or the risk one takes should be **proportionate to the value of the person** in relation to one’s own happiness.

>The fact that a man has no claim on others (i.e., that it is not their moral duty to help him and that he cannot demand their help as his right) does not preclude or prohibit good will among men and does not make it immoral to offer or to accept voluntary, non-sacrificial assistance.

When asked about supporting her husband financially: "I am in love with him selfishly. I would not call that a sacrifice because I take selfish pleasure in it" 

And if she did accept government aid? She saw it as a form of restitution for what had already been taken from an individual in the form of taxes.
