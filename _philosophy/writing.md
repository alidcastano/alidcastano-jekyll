## Write for yourself

Write for a reader of one: you. 

Writing well means believing in your writing and believing in yourself, taking risks, daring to be different, pushing yourself to excel. You will write only as well as you make yourself write. 
<small> - excerpt from *On Writing Well* </small>

Goals:

**Deliver value with every sentence.** Else, be quite.

**Bleed in the first line.** Want people to relate to you? Be human. <small> *- James Altucher* </small>

**Be Honest.** Say what everyone thinks but nobody ever says. 

**Be specific.** Concrete details are easier to process and derive meaning from than vague abstractions. Be specific about who you were in that moment in time. Only then will people be able to take away their own meaning from your story. 

**Be relatable.** Show how you are trying and struggling, a person’s faults are largely what make him or her likable.

**Be entertaining** Give the reader an enjoyable surprise. Any number of devices will do the job: humor, anecdote, paradox, an unexpected quotation, a powerful fact, an outlandish detail, an elegant arrangement of words. This is your “style," your personality as you express your ideas on paper.    
<small> - excerpt from *On Writing Well* </small>

**Don't go peeing down both legs.** Express your opinion firmly. And don't ask for permission to do it. We know it's your opinion. 

**Use a lot of periods.** Your sentences should be strong enough that you want people to pause and think about it. <small> *- James Altucher* </small>

**Stop caring about what people think.** For each single person you worry about, deduct 1% in quality from your writing. <small> *- James Altucher* </small>


The best kind of writing understands you somehow without even knowing you.

# Start your draft; write badly 

The first draft of anything is shit. <small> *- Ernest Hemingway* </small>

The first draft is only for you to see. 

You have permission to write badly. All writers struggle with first draft. 

Overcome the blank page. 

Small quota: Two crappy pages per day. (That way you won't be intimidated, and likely overshoot that.)


Ask, why am I writing? What excites or frustrates you? 


**Watch the Polaroid develop.** You can’t — and, in fact, you’re not supposed to— know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing. First you just point at what has your attention and take the picture. <small> - excerpt from *Bird by bird* </small>

**Write freely.** As rapidly as possible throw the whole thing on paper. Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down. (Rewrite in process is usually found to be an excuse for not going on.) <small> *- John Steinbeck* </small> 

If you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said. <small>*- Paul Graham* </small>

**Start in the middle.** You don’t know the first sentence until you’ve written the last.

Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong. <small>*- Paul Graham* </small>

**Stuck? Skip it.** If section gets the better of you and you still think you want it, bypass it and go on. When you have finished the whole you can come back to it and then you may find that the reason it gave trouble is because it didn’t belong there (and you were trying too hard to make it fit). <small> *- John Steinbeck* </small> 

*"When I write, I feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth."*  
<small>   *- Kurt Vonnegut* </small>     (Perfectionism is the enemy. Messes are the artist’s true friend.) 


# Then rewrite; write well 

The best writing is rewriting. <small>*- E. B. White*</small>

Before rewriting: mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook with you.

While editing: When you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with.

## Write like you talk 

ASK: Is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?

You’ve spent your whole life learning how to communicate with that voice.

Pretend that someone is sitting in front of you and write as if you're talking to them. <small> *- James Patterson* </small>

Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous. <small>*- Paul Graham* </small>

Style is the originality of your thought. What you feel and think will by itself invent a new style. Style is the attempt to express a new idea with such force that it will have the originality of the thought.

If it sounds like writing, rewrite it. <small> *- Elmore Leonard* </small>

Don't let a sentence through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.

## Write less

ASK: Does this line deliver value?  

Writing is 1 percent inspiration, and 99 percent elimination.                <small> *- Louise Brooks* </small>

It takes more work to write a short post. You spend twice as much time editing as you do writing.

All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know. <small> *- Ernest Hemingway* </small>

If a sentence, no matter how excellent, does not illuminate your subject in some new and useful way, scratch it out. <small> *- Kurt Vonnegut* </small>

Because the writer who breeds more words than he needs, is making a chore for the reader who reads. <small> *- Dr. Seuss* </small>

## Write simply 

ASK: Am I using the shortest, most simple words and sentences I can?

My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way. <small> *- Ernest Hemingway* </small>

Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you're talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be perceived as having a good style. <small>*- Paul Graham* </small>

## Read your work out loud

Read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading). <small> *- Paul Graham* </small>

## Share Your Work

Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.                <small> *- Paul Graham* </small>

Present a single idea, one at a time, and let others build upon it.
<small> *- Derek Sivers* </small>

## Write, wave by wave

Writing is like surfing — you are riding stories. You sit there and wait for ideas to come. The present-moment inspired ideas are the ones worth riding, look for fresh waves. When the idea arrives, feel its momentum and ride it out as best as you can, all the way to shore.
